If you just had one viral particle on your finger, it’s unlikely that you’re going to be infected. Some viruses are very potent, you only need like 10 particles to get infected, while others you [may] need millions. The fewer viral particles you’re exposed to, the less likely you’re going to get infected. That’s why the amount of virus on a surface is important.', 'Marcus: As far as we know right now, people are much more likely to be infected by close contact with an infected person than by touching a contaminated surface. That said, it’s still important to be conscious of what we’re touching, especially high-touch surfaces, and be careful about cleaning our hands after touching things. For example, public transit or grocery stores and places where there tend to be a lot of people.', 'Iwasaki: The virus is pretty stable on [materials] like plastic and steel – they can persist for a few days. So it’s very possible that someone who’s sick will deposit the virus on to the surface and then somebody else will touch it and touch their face.', 'Marcus: It’s a low risk, but it’s possible that if someone is delivering a package to your house and they are sick, that may be a route for transmission.

If Taylor had been laid off just a week earlier and claimed EI, she would be getting that benefit instead of CERB and her concerns would be justified.', 'Receiving CERB does not affect entitlement to maternity and parental benefits, but EI does, said a spokesperson for Employment and Social Development Canada in an email.', 'Employment experts say navigating this new mix of worker benefit programs could leave some pregnant parents  to fall through the cracks.', 'Lara Speirs, executive vice-president at human resources consulting firm Randstad Canada, and Toronto employment lawyer Madeleine Loewenberg are just two experts who hope the government can iron out the details so that expecting Canadians on EI or CERB don’t have to worry about getting their full maternity and parental benefits when the time comes. ', 'They have identified two ways in which the pandemic could be throwing a wrench in maternity and parental leave plans.', 'The first problem, says Speirs, is the one Taylor narrowly avoided. ', 'EI, maternity and parental benefits are all administered through the same program. A person is entitled to a total of 50 weeks, regardless of the combination — meaning for every week of EI they take, they’ll get one less week of maternity or parental leave.', '“When a person combines regular benefits, maternity benefits and standard parental benefits in one claim, there is a limit of 50 weeks in total,” confirmed the government spokesperson.', 'The spokesperson also noted that there are options for extended parental benefits. However, Loewenberg pointed out that while you can extend parental leave to get up to 18 months off, you won’t get any more money — you’ll just get less per week. ', 'Regular maternity or parental leave is calculated like EI — 55 per cent of insurable earnings, up to $573 per week, said Loewenberg. If you extend that leave, which is possible for up to six extra months, you’ll get 33 per cent of insurable earnings, up to $344 per week. ', 'So, if someone lost their job because of the pandemic, applied for EI before March 15, and then later applies for maternity leave, they will be eligible for fewer weeks of maternity/parental leave, and less money even if they extend their leave.', 'Speirs thinks this gap could be fixed by either removing the arbitrary March 15 date, or by allowing parents-to-be already on EI to switch over to CERB.', 'You’re effectively penalized for being pregnant and for the timing of your layoff, she said.', 'Loewenberg understands the government had to set a deadline, but she thinks expecting Canadians in this position shouldn’t lose their benefits because of it.', 'The second issue, said Speirs, is the fact that depending on an individual’s previous employment situation and when they got laid off, they might lose their eligibility for maternity or parental leave.', '“You need to accumulate 600 insured hours of work in the 52 weeks before you start your maternity or paternity claim,” she said.', 'So, while someone may have CERB to tide them over after losing their income, they might find themselves ineligible for maternity or parental leave when they apply.', 'The longer someone is on CERB and the fewer hours they worked in 2019, the more likely this will affect their maternity claim, Loewenberg said.', '“The weeks of insurable earnings start to fall away the longer you wait from the loss of your employment to the date of your application,” she said, adding that she sees this as a “hole” that has yet to be filled by the government.', 'There are a few other things expecting Canadians should know if they plan to go on maternity/parental leave, or are just coming off of it, said Speirs and Loewenberg.', 'Canadians have the option of applying for maternity leave early, within 12 weeks of the expected birth date.', 'If you were temporarily laid off at first, and then find yourself permanently laid off during your maternity or parental leave, you are entitled to severance by the end of your leave, said Speirs.', 'And, if you just got off of maternity or parental leave and are now out of work because of COVID-19, you’re eligible for CERB, she said.', 'Speirs noted that in Quebec — a leader when it comes to parental leave — a parent can pause the maternity or parental leave to go back to work for a brief period of time. ', 'Both Loewenberg and Speirs recommend those waiting for maternity leave should take CERB in the meantime, even though there are a few unanswered questions.', 'OTTAWA—Cliff Groen gulped when he saw the numbers. ', 'It was the middle of March, and even as the economy quavered and COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic, Groen and his colleagues at Service Canada were chugging along as usual. Jobless claims stayed steady at around 7,500 each day, processed at the routine pace of bureaucracy. ', 'Then the wave hit, and it hit hard. ', 'Service Canada got more than 71,000 applications for employment insurance on March 16, the most ever in a single day — until the next day, when it got more than 88,000. ', 'By the time the tally for the third day came in at more than 130,000 claims, Groen knew routine wasn’t good enough anymore. They would need to change everything — fast. ', '“Definitely there was a big gulp on my part and lots of my colleagues,” Groen, the assistant deputy minister of benefits delivery at Service Canada, told the Star by phone this week. ', '“Unless we did something dramatically different,” he said, “there would be no way we would be able to process those applications on any kind of a timely basis.” ', 'You could say the necessity to do something completely different is the modus operandi of the public service in the time of coronavirus. With thousands of workers shifting to home offices, Ottawa has redeployed workers to process millions of jobless claims as Groen and his team designed a whole new program to replace EI and reach more people — it’s called the Canada Emergency Response Benefit — over the span of just three weeks. ', 'At the same time, the government has reimagined its industrial policy to rally Canadian companies to the coronavirus fight by converting factories to pump out much-needed medical equipment. Charles Vincent, an acting assistant deputy minister responsible for COVID-19 industry mobilization, said he has seen hundreds of civil servants step up to clock in extra hours to field thousands of proposals to help domestic manufacturers convert to help with the pandemic fight. This included a complete reorganization of his department as workers focus exclusively on the crisis, he said. ', '“I have not seen anything quite like this ever before, to be frank, and it’s been three weeks at this pace — 16, 17 hours a day, seven days a week,” he said.', 'Groen and his team at Service Canada shifted into high gear that week after they received record-setting jobless claims for three days in a row. That was a “call to arms” for the team, Groen said, which began immediately with a rush of meetings and briefings to other departments and cabinet ministers about the tsunami of EI claims flooding in. ', 'Groen said it was clear even then that the current EI system wouldn’t cut it. They needed something simpler and quicker. They also wanted to make sure people that aren’t eligible for regular EI — like self-employed business owners and people who leave work to care for someone else — received government support amid the pandemic, he said. ', '“The other key element was it needed to be extremely speedy. We knew that we couldn’t take months to develop and launch this new program,” Groen said. ', 'The rush carried into that weekend, March 20 and 21, as public servants scrambled to write legislation to create the new benefit, Groen said. IT workers with Service Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency also started the crucial task of creating the web platform for applications that would need to be able to carry the huge volume of expected requests, he said. ', 'Like many of his colleagues, Groen said he was working 18 to 20 hour days, walking home to crash briefly before returning to the Service Canada headquarters in Gatineau, Que. ', '“Typically there are lots of checks and balances within government. Normally the policy design is developed, and there’s consultation, and there’s review by different areas within government,” Groen said. ', 'Instead, from the realization a new program was needed when legislation was tabled in the House of Commons on March 24, six days had passed. After that, it was a matter of testing the system to make sure it could handle the volume, and then applications opened April 6. ', 'About 4.58 million of 5 million claims had been processed by Thursday this week, including EI claims since March 15 that were rolled into the new benefit, according to Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough’s office.', '“In my career, and I’ve been a public servant for over 20 years, I have never seen anything in that order, and then in less than three weeks it was fully launched,” Groen said. ', '“There’s nothing in my career that compares to that.” ', 'Mollie Jacques is a chef in Toronto who lost her job last month, applied for EI, and received two payments already this week. While she questioned whether she received the right amount of money, and noted many she knows in her beleaguered industry are still confused how the benefit works, Jacques said she is “impressed” to see the payments flowing so soon.', '“As someone who has applied for EI before, two to three months is the normal amount of time it takes,” she said. “I’ve dealt with the government quite a bit over the years, and snail’s pace is what I normally expect … I’m honestly surprised that it has come together this quickly.”', 'Groen said he has never been prouder to be a public servant that during the pandemic. ', '“Especially when we were able to launch the benefit and knew that people were going to be able to get their payments, tears did come to lots of our eyes,” he said. “We were so happy and proud that we … were there for Canadians.” ', 'The latest round of government projections related to the COVID-19 pandemic includes an increasingly common phrase — reaching the peak. But what exactly does that mean? Some experts weigh in:', 'What does it mean to reach a peak in a pandemic?', 'Infectious disease and statistical modelling specialists say to reach the peak in a pandemic curve means that the number of new cases has begun to level off rather than continuing on a sharp upward trajectory. Such a scenario is playing out this week in Ontario, where public health officials said the province was experiencing the peak of the outbreak in the broader community despite registering some sharp single-day spikes in the number of new cases. The peak has not yet arrived in the province’s long-term care system, where roughly half of all cases and deaths have occurred.', '“Peaks are not a single day,” said Steini Brown, dean of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, as he presented the province’s latest projections on Monday. “They’re not a nice single sort of spike. They can be a little bit bumpy, they can be prolonged for a period of time, particularly given public health interventions.”', 'Brown said pandemic curves are usually symmetrical in nature — a sharp increase of cases is followed by the plateau or peak, which then gives way to a decline in new diagnoses.', 'Where in Canada is that actually happening?', 'While Ontario may be experiencing the peak of community transmission right now, several provinces are already ahead of the game. Public health officials in British Columbia said last week that they had succeeded in flattening the curve, meaning they’re past the peak of new COVID-19 cases. Provinces and territories such as Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the Yukon are posting single-digit increases each day, while New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador have gone several days in a row without any new cases at all.', 'Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, has said the national curve is bending but has yet to flatten. Those figures are still fuelled by data out of Quebec and Ontario, the epicentres of the national outbreak. The premier of Quebec, which has recorded more than 20,100 of Canada’s roughly 38,000 cases, has said the peak has lightly been reached outside of the province’s hard-hit long-term care homes.', 'This is all good news, right?', 'Yes and no. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious diseases physician and scientist with the Toronto General Hospital, says it’s very encouraging to see the rate of new infections begin to level off. But he says peak times also promise to place the maximum strain on the health-care system, as cases continue to mount at a pace not seen during earlier stages of the outbreak.', 'Jianhong Wu, distinguished research professor of mathematics at York University, said other risks come with pandemic peaks.', '“At these times, the level of infections is highest,” he said. “The number of cases is not necessarily the number of infections.”', 'Wu noted that disparity is even more evident in parts of the country with lower testing levels, noting those provinces with higher capacity will also uncover more cases.', 'During a peak period, he said, Canadians stand a higher chance of contracting the virus.', 'Does this mean normal life can resume soon?', 'No. Both Wu and Bogoch said physical distancing measures are more important than ever during peak times in order to ensure the number of cases begins to decline as expected.', '“Imagine you’re in a car and you put your foot on the gas and are driving faster and faster,” Bogoch said. “When you get onto the highway and you’re going 100 kilometres an hour, that’s not the time to open the door and jump out of the car. You have to actually slow down.”', 'What are the most useful stats to keep an eye on?', 'The many facts and figures presented in government briefings are all valuable in tracking Canada’s response to COVID-19, according to both Bogoch and Wu. But for a member of the public wanting only to focus on the highlights, they agree tracking the growth rate of cases over time should provide an adequate snapshot.

Their model, seen as more secure and immune from hacking by some experts due to spreading the collected information, is also backed by tech giants Apple and Google. The UK has instead developed its own centralised app with data sent to the Government's servers when someone registers coronavirus symptoms, allowing the NHS to send them a test in the post.\\xa0\\xa0 Critics have argued that by not using the same app or framework as the Europeans the two systems are not compatible, meaning Brits travelling to those countries could be unnecessarily placed in\\xa0quarantine for 14 days upon arrival once the lockdown is eased. The US is also expected to plump for the\\xa0Apple - Google model. Lawyers have also suggested that it may also breach human rights and data protection laws - and the NHS is now facing questions about the decision to develop an app when other countries are plumping for the more privacy-centric approach.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Matthew Ryder, a QC at Matrix Chambers in London - who sits n the Guardian's Scott Trust - has warned the app could be illegal and suggested it is 'inevitable' the nationwide rollout of the app could be challenged in the High Court. Tory MP Damian Collins has also published ten questions about how the government will protects app users' data.\\xa0\\xa0  The NHS is rolling out its new coronavirus track-and-trace app today for testing across the Isle of Wight. This is how it will work STEP ONE: DOWNLOAD THE APP Britons will be able to download the app for free from the Department of Health website. It is also available vi the Apple and Android app stores or via a link sent by email to NHS and public sector workers.\\xa0 It is being tested on the Isle of Wight before a potential roll-out across the country, probably one region at a time.  STEP TWO:\\xa0 PROVIDE A PARTIAL POSTCODE To register the person will be asked to provide the first half of their postcode, which shows the NHS the town or borough they live in - but not their name or their exact home address. The user will be asked to allow the app to use the phone's bluetooth to keep track of other phones it comes in to close to and for how long for.\\xa0 The NHS insists it will not be tracking location data - only phones But while the Government has said 'your postcode will not be used to track your location' - it is less clear if they also mean your location will not be tracked at all.  STEP THREE: KEEP YOUR PHONE ON The user will be told to keep their phone and Bluetooth switched on at all times and the app will run in the background without them doing anything. The user will also be asked to allow 'push notifications' - which allows the NHS to send a person messages directly to their phones.\\xa0 When an individual goes out, the app will keep a log of every time it comes within Bluetooth range of another phone - but that person must also have the app.\\xa0 All IDs will be anonymous, with each app registered to a code rather than a person or address.  STEP FOUR: REPORT YOUR SYMPTOMS IF YOU BECOME ILL If someone becomes ill they will be asked to log on to the app and input it. They will be asked if they have the common symptoms of coronavirus such as a high temperature and a continuous cough. If no, nothing will happen. If yes, they will be told to order a coronavirus test. STEP FIVE: APP SENDS YOUR DATA TO THE NHS SERVER FOR ANALYSIS BY EXPERTS If it is a suspected coronavirus case these symptoms and the anonymous IDs of all the phones the user has come into contact with are automatically sent to an NHS server. The NHS will analyse the data sent by the original sufferer using what it calls a 'complex algorithm'. Although it is believed to be largely based on distance of between one and two metres, and the amount of time, probably around ten to 15 minutes.  STEP SIX: NHS SENDS A TAILORED YELLOW AND RED ALERTS TO CONTACTS\\xa0 It will then alert app users who have been in ‘significant contact’ with the original person with symptoms. For those who have been in contact with someone who has self reported symptoms, the app will send a yellow alert. In early versions of the app, this warns the user that they have been in contact with someone who has reported symptoms. If the original sufferer tests positive, everyone they have been in contact with will receive a stronger 'red' alert telling them to go into quarantine. The origInal sufferer triggers the red alert by entering a PIN issued by the NHS after they test positive.\\xa0 The Department of Health has not revealed exactly what the alerts will say. The Department of Health says: 'The app will advise the public what action to take if a user has been close to someone who has become symptomatic. The advice on what people should do can be adapted as the context and approach evolves.' The app will calculate how at risk a contact is by measuring their exposure to the person with symptoms. It will measure exposure by time and proximity. The NHS analysts will set the risk parameters that trigger alerts. STEP SEVEN: ORIGINAL SUFFERER CONTACTED BY HUMAN NHS CONTACT TRACERS The app will issue the original person with symptoms instructions on how to get a test using the software.\\xa0 One of around 10,000 UK human contact tracers may also get in contact on the phone and ask the app user how many people are in their household, where they have been and who they have been close to, that they know of, to find people who may not have been picked up by the bluetooth. They will also try to contact these new contacts if required.\\xa0  STEP EIGHT: SUFFERER IS TESTED Once the Covid-19 test arrives at the person's home they will be expected to swab and then put it back in the post to an NHS testing centre. They may also be eligible for a home test by a health worker or visit one of the country's test centres. The result should be available within 48 hours. There are then two possible outcomes: •\\xa0 The person\\xa0tests negative. In this case, your contacts are told via a message that it was a false notification. • The person tests positive. In this case, your contacts are asked to isolate for 14 days, and get them into the clinical testing path.\\xa0 STEP NINE: HUMAN CONTACT TRACERS CONTACT AT-RISK CONTACTS OF ORIGINAL SUFFERER AND PLOT HOTSPOTS The NHS' army of human contact tracers will contact app users who have been in 'significant contact' with the original person with symptoms will be alerted through the app. They will provided with 'health advice' – which may include self isolation – based on the NHS' assessment of their level of risk. Not everyone who has been in contact will be alerted based on the NHS algorithm. This advice will be constantly modified by doctors based on the current sutuation.  If a hotspot of new cases emerges, the users will be advised to take more urgent action, such as staying at home or even seeking medical attention. The NHS team of contact tracers will then individually contact everyone who has been in contact with the sufferer, either through the app or by other means.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 Germany Italy\\xa0 Switzerland Austria Estonia Ireland\\xa0 - The United States of America is expected to use it - but no final decision has been made yet\\xa0 He told the BBC:\\xa0'The government needs to justify why they are going for the system that has a greater interference than the one that should do the job with less interference. 'If Germany, the US and Italy can all do the job that we want to do with a decentralised system that Apple and Google have facilitated, which is the least interference of privacy, we need to understand why the UK thinks it can't do the job and needs a different system.\\xa0 'What the Information Commissioner said that we agree with is that there needs to be a data impact assessment. So that the information commissioner and everyone else can understand what the data impact assessment is and why the NHS thinks they need these extra interferences with\\xa0our privacy in order to be able to do the job. This is a really important thing and we need to protect rights'. He added:\\xa0'It's almost inevitable that if the Government doesn't take the approach that the information commissioner and others are suggesting, hopefully they will, then are going to be legal implications including the possibility of a legal challenge. '\\xa0 After today's tests all Isle of Wight residents will be able to download the software on to their smartphones from Thursday.\\xa0 If the tests are successful it could be rolled out across the country within weeks as ministers seek to shape a strategy to allow some economic activity to resume, with the long-awaited 'roadmap' for easing lockdown being published on Sunday.\\xa0 Users will input into the app when they have symptoms linked to Covid-19. Developed by NHSX, the health service's tech innovation arm, the software will then use Bluetooth to anonymously monitor and log when app users come into contact with each other. The software will alert people if they have been in close contact with someone who later fell ill with coronavirus,\\xa0which has killed 28,734 in the UK so far, so they can self-isolate and be tested if necessary.\\xa0\\xa0 Some MPs have raised concerns about privacy and the amount of data it will gather - but the NHS insists it is vital\\xa0to stop further outbreaks of the virus and to prevent people from spreading the virus without realising they have it, as well as alerting authorities to local clusters of cases.\\xa0 Google and Apple have managed to develop software which serves the same function but in a way that contains all the necessary data inside someone's phone and doesn't need a server. Other countries including Germany and Switzerland are using this approach.\\xa0 Because no movement or tracking information is stored on a central server, it would be invisible to Google, Apple and the NHS and there would be nothing to hack. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a user's phone will store anonymously the information about all the phones it has been within two metres of for more than 15 minutes in the previous few days. He said one of the aspects being tested in the trial on the Isle of Wight is whether the best thing is for someone who gets a message saying they have been in contact with someone with symptoms should self-isolate 'in case you develop the symptoms'. He told BBC Breakfast: 'This is one of the reasons that we want to test it to ensure that we get the rules right around what we advise people to do as soon as the contact tracing pings you.' Mr Hancock said the app would allow the Government to have a picture of where there might be virus hotspots. He said: 'The more people who have the app the better.' He said human contact tracing is important alongside technology. He said: 'Of course we use the technology but we're going to be using people too in this test, track and trace system.'\\xa0\\xa0 Mr Hancock said it was being used on the Isle of Wight because the fact that the population is small and cut off from the mainland meant the experiment could be carried out in 'proper scientifically-controlled conditions'. Pressed on privacy and the use of data, Mr Hancock reiterated that information will be stored on a person's phone until the point they need to get in contact with the NHS to get a test. He said: 'I think we can give very significant reassurances on the privacy aspect but what I can tell you is that if you download the app then you are doing your duty and you are helping to save lives, and you're helping to control the spread of the virus, and that's true as of this morning on the Isle of Wight amongst NHS staff, but it'll be true increasingly across the country as we roll it out.' Mr Hancock said the app is 'a very, very positive step in terms of us all being able to get some of our liberty back'.\\xa0 Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen has said the Government should look at decentralised app models - where contact-tracing data stays on a user’s device. The organisation’s concerns that “the Government may be planning to route private data through a central database, opening the door to pervasive state surveillance and privacy infringement, with potentially discriminatory effects” was put to the Health Secretary. Mr Hancock responded: “That’s completely wrong.” Asked why, he said: “Firstly because the data is stored on your phone until you need to get in contact with the NHS in order to get a test and secondly because the purposes of this are purely and simply to control the spread of the virus, which is really important. “Thirdly because we’ve all had to give up significant infringements on our liberty, for instance with the social distancing measures and the lockdown, and we want to release those, and this approach will help us to release them ... I can reassure you that it’s completely untrue.” If the island trial is successful the Government plans to roll out the app to everyone across the UK as a crucial element of its 'test, track and trace' plan for keeping the country out of lockdown in future as it adapts to life with the virus. Deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, said today: 'It's highly unlikely that the COVID-19 virus is going to go away... therefore, testing and contact tracing is going to have to become part of our daily lives for the future'.\\xa0 Experts say 60 per cent of the population or more will need to download the app for it to work well. Government figures have not put a target on uptake but will urge everybody who can to download the app when it becomes available, adopting the mantra 'download the app, protect the NHS, save lives'. The app will rely on people being honest about when they feel ill - data must be put into the app by the user. It is not clear what will constitute close enough contact for someone to be alerted that they are at risk.\\xa0The World Health Organization's rule is 15 minutes within six-and-a-half feet (2m), but the Department of Health said a 'complex risk algorithm' would dictate who would be warned.\\xa0 The programme on the Isle of Wight will carry on for around two weeks to check whether the system works and whether people actually download and use it properly. If successful, the app will start to be used on mainland Britain from mid-May, the Department of Health said, while continuing on the Isle of Wight.\\xa0 But there are concerns that the data the NHS app collects might be vulnerable because officials have elected to store it on a central database on NHS servers. Some other countries including Switzerland and Germany are using technology which stores all data on someone's own phone and never submits it to authorities.\\xa0 The CEO of NHSX, the digital arm of the health service, today said he could not confirm exactly who would have access to data collected by the NHS app, saying only that an organisation must have a valid public health reason to access it. He insisted that the app will never upload private, identifying information such as someone's name or address. The app has also failed the tests it must pass to be officially listed on the NHS app store, including cyber-security measures, according to claims made by an NHS official in the\\xa0Health Service Journal.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It is reported to be below the normal standards the NHS requires to officially publish an app for mobile users, and has not lived up to expectations set on cyber-security, performance and its 'clinical safety'. Exactly how it failed those measures is unclear. The Department of Health disputed the reports and called them 'factually untrue', insisting the app is being fast-tracked, has not failed any tests and will go through normal approval channels after it is rolled out on the Isle of Wight. People will be asked to give the first half of their postcode so the NHS can collect vague, anonymised data - at town or village level - about where outbreaks of the coronavirus are appearing (pictured left). If someone has been close to a person who is later believed to be ill with COVID-19 they will receive an anonymous alert that they are at risk (right) People eligible for the app will be sent a download link when it is available for them to start using. It will rely on people accurately reporting whether they are ill or not, or have tested positive. Contacts will be advised to self-isolate while someone is tested Downloading and using the app will be voluntary but officials hope huge numbers of people will be persuaded to take part in the hope of lifting movement restrictions. The app technologies developed by Google/Apple and the NHS are based on the same principle - they keep a log of who someone has come into close contact with - but the way they store data is the main difference. The NHS's keeps information in a centralised database, while the Google/Apple app is de-centralised. NHS app: Lists on NHS servers\\xa0 The NHSX app will create an alert every time two app users come within Bluetooth range of one another and log this in the user's phone. Each person will essentially build up a list of everyone they have been in 'contact' with. This will be anonymised so the lists will actually just be numbers or codes, not lists of names or addresses.\\xa0 If someone is diagnosed with the coronavirus or reports that they have symptoms, all the app users they got close to during the time that they were considered infectious - this will vary from person to person - will receive an alert telling them they have been put at risk of COVID-19 - but it won't name the person who was diagnosed.\\xa0 NHSX insists it will delete people's data when they get rid of the app.\\xa0 Apple/Google: Contained on phones In Apple and Google's de-centralised approach, meanwhile, the server and list element of this process is removed and the entire log is contained in someone's phone. That app works by exchanging a digital 'token' with every phone someone comes within Bluetooth range of over a fixed period. If one person develops symptoms of the coronavirus or tests positive, they will be able to enter this information into the app. The phone will then send out a notification to all the devices they have exchanged tokens with during the infection window, to make people aware they may have been exposed to COVID-19. The server database will not be necessary because each phone will keep an individual log of the bluetooth profiles someone has come close to. These will then be linked anonymously to people's NHS apps and alerts can be pushed through that even after the person is out of bluetooth range. It is understood that if someone later deletes the Google/Apple app and closes their account their data would be erased.\\xa0 Will NHS benefit from central data? If the NHS collects the data it may be able to use it as part of wider contact tracing efforts as well as being able to detect local outbreaks using location data. In future, if someone is diagnosed with COVID-19, members of an army of 18,000 'contact tracers' will be tasked with working out who else that patient has come into contact with and put at risk. It is not clear how much access the human contact tracers will have to data collected through the app.\\xa0 NHS and council staff on the Isle of Wight will be sent a download link by email today, and residents on the island will receive letters in the post with instructions on how to get the app on Thursday.\\xa0 It is being trialled on the Isle of Wight because it is a small, self-contained community which is easier to control, Mr Hancock said. Initial testing was carried out on an even smaller self-contained community at RAF Leeming, an air base in North Yorkshire, and it is now being scaled up. Mr Hancock\\xa0 claimed that on the Isle of Wight it could be tested in 'scientific' conditions because people cannot come and go freely\\xa0- there is no bridge or tunnel between the Isle and mainland Britain. It will be easier for officials to get a clear idea of what proportion of the population has downloaded the app, and to get tests for large parts of communities quickly.\\xa0 But privacy concerns have been raised about the way the app works.\\xa0 Dr Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights at University College London, said on BBC Radio 4 this morning: 'One thing people need to do is have deep trust that this data will not be misused or that the system will not turn slowly into something that starts to identify people more individually.' The NHSX app focuses on a centralised approach in which any interactions between people are recorded by the phone and then, if someone is flagged as a coronavirus patient, sent back to a server run by the NHS.\\xa0 NHSX is on an offensive to assuage people's concerns about privacy and insists that no personal information will be collected. People will be identified by codes which are not linked to their name or address. Instead, the app will keep a log of Bluetooth connections between codes and, when one of the codes is upgraded to signify that the patient attached to it has tested positive or become ill (this will be done by the user via the app), other codes which had been in contact with that one will be alerted anonymously.\\xa0 All the connections - which will look to the human eye like a series of pairs of numbers, with one number in common - will then be uploaded to a central NHS database and stored. NHSX chief executive, Matthew Gould, confirmed the app will collect no specific personal data from users such as their name or address. He said: 'The app is designed so you don't have to give it your personal details to use it – it does ask for the first half of your postcode but only that.\\xa0 'You can use it without giving any other personal details at all – it doesn't know who you are, it doesn't know who you've been near, it doesn't know where you've been.'\\xa0 But experts say this level of data collection - tracking the movements of one unchanging number and linking it to others - is fraught with hazards. It is possible that if the data was hacked, one of the codes - each person's identifying code remains the same over time -\\xa0 could be linked to a person if the hacker could pinpoint the code and person in the same place. This could then be used to track them repeatedly as their Bluetooth checked in at other places. The NHS is now facing questions as to why it needs to develop the app in this manner when other countries are plumping for the more privacy-centric approach. Google and Apple have managed to develop software which serves the same function but in a way that contains all the necessary data inside someone's phone and doesn't need a server. Other countries including Germany and Switzerland are using this approach.\\xa0 Because no movement or tracking information is stored on a central server, it would be invisible to Google, Apple and the NHS and there would be nothing to hack. That technology works by exchanging a digital 'token' with every phone someone comes within Bluetooth range of over a fixed period. If one person develops symptoms of the coronavirus or tests positive, they will be able to enter this information into the app. The phone will then send out a notification to all the devices they have exchanged tokens with during the infection window, to make people aware they may have been exposed to COVID-19. The process is confined to the individual's handset and the scope of the information sent to the NHS is strictly limited.\\xa0        Trump claims he's on hydroxychloroquine at restaurant round-table Woman who drove two hours to beach complains about social distancing Hilarious moment police raid a virtual pub lock in Crowd flaunts social distancing to watch pub car park brawl Bodies of two women discovered in Peacehaven, East Sussex Cat shows off goalkeeping skills as it slaps ball away from net Former PM Tony Blair supports reopening the school system Actor gives hilarious virtual tour of flat after being 'forced out' Restaurant unveils 'bumper tables' to keep diners six feet apart Mourners outside Frankline Ndifor's home pray for his resurrection Paraglider performs death-defying flips high in the air Father goes missing while lifeguards save son at Venice Beach Experts fear that the system could be used to label people as infected or at-risk in a way that other people would be able to see, meaning they could face discrimination. Dr Veale said: 'We've seen in China the traffic light system of red, yellow, green - 'are you suitable to come into this building or come into work' - and a centralised system is really just a few steps away from creating those kind of persistent identifiers that allow you to make that kind of approach. 'Whereas a decentralised system really does proximity tracing and does not do more than that. People can trust that technically.'\\xa0\\xa0 With the NHS's approach, people will have to trust the health service and therefore the Government with their personal information. Human rights group Amnesty International raised alarm about the prospect. Scientists have said they are worried about 'mission creep' in which people are told the data will be used for one thing but then the people controlling the data decide to use it for something else. Amnesty International UK director, Kate Allen, said the Government should be looking at decentralised app models where contact-tracing data stays on a user's device.\\xa0 The Isle of Wight is an island off the south coast of England, linked by ferry to Portsmouth and Southampton. The island has a population of around 141,000 people. More than a quarter of all its residents (27.3 per cent) are older than 65, and the proportion is increasing. It is one of the most elderly communities in England & Wales.\\xa0 Its biggest town is Newport and has a population of just 18,700 people. Only three towns on the island have more than 10,000 residents. One in six houses are occupied by someone older than 65 living on their own. The Isle of Wight is off the coast of Portsmouth and Southampton The vast majority of people on the island are white and British - 94.8 per cent, compared to 85.9 per cent in England. Just under two per cent are 'other white', while just over one per cent are Asian. Bob Seely MBE is the MP for the island. He is a member of the Conservative Party and has held office since 2017. The Conservatives also hold a majority on the borough council. However, officials says they are maintaining strict privacy rules while also gathering anonymous data about the numbers of coronavirus cases in certain areas, which could help hospitals to plan for outbreaks, for example. Ms Allen said: 'We're extremely concerned that the Government may be planning to route private data through a central database, opening the door to pervasive state surveillance and privacy infringement, with potentially discriminatory effects.\\xa0 'Ministers should instead be examining decentralised, privacy-preserving models such as those many European governments are pursuing.\\xa0 'In these extraordinary times, contact-tracing apps and other technology could potentially be useful tools in responding to COVID-19, but our privacy and rights must not become another casualty of the virus.' Dr Veale also promoted the benefits of the de-centralised model, adding: 'In the Apple and Google approach... you don't need to trust Apple and Google with your data because it never leaves your device. 'It removes the need to have an identifiable central database of any sort whatsoever. This is being used in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Estonia and also in Ireland.'\\xa0 The app will form a crucial part of the Government's three-point 'test, track and trace' plan for helping the country to recover from its current crisis. This will work by officials closely watching where and when new cases and outbreaks of the virus appear and isolating people to stamp them out. First, anyone who is suspected of having the virus will be tested - there are still currently limits on who can get a test, but these are expected to be lifted by the time the country moves out of lockdown. If someone tests positive, they will be told to self-isolate as long as they are otherwise healthy and don't need hospital treatment. Their households will have to isolate with them and then Government 'contact tracers' will work to establish a social network around the patient. This will involve working out everyone who has come into close enough contact with the patient that they are at risk of having been infected with COVID-19. All the people in that social network will then also be told to self-isolate until they can be sure they're virus free, or until they are diagnosed with a test. If they test positive, the same contact tracing procedure will begin for them. The app will be a vital part of this contact tracing effort, because it will be able to alert people who the patient may have put at risk without them knowing - at a shop or doctor's surgery, for example.\\xa0 Cybersecurity experts and human rights experts are also concerned about 'mission creep' in which the app starts off with one purpose but then officials decide to use its data for something else.\\xa0\\xa0 Professor Mark Ryan, a computer security lecturer at the University of Birmingham, said: 'Everyone agrees that proximity tracing is a vital part of combating COVID and ending the lockdown.\\xa0 'However, we have to be sure that proximity tracing technology does not lead to unfettered surveillance of people's movements and activities.\\xa0 'To this end, we call upon the\\xa0government to publish open source code of the apps and server processes that will be used.\\xa0 'Remember that, unlike the cases of surveillance to combat terrorism or other crime, there is no requirement of secrecy in what strategies and technologies are being used against COVID.' Information collected by the app will also give the Government insight into where the virus is spreading. As officials continue to track the virus in future, they will have to try to work out how many people who have had COVID-19 in the past and recovered.\\xa0\\xa0 The roll-out of 'immunity passports' is being considered by ministers as part of the government's attempts to get Britain back to work after the coronavirus lockdown is eased. Ministers are believed to be in talks with tech firms about developing a form of digital identification which would verify who someone is and show whether they have been tested for the disease. The passports could either be based on antigen testing which shows if someone currently has coronavirus or on antibody testing which shows if someone has had it. The digital documents would show if someone has tested negative on an antigen test or if they have shown to have some resistance to coronavirus after an antibody test, demonstrating to an employer they are safe to re-enter the workplace. Such a scheme could be a game-changer for ministers as they try to figure out how to kickstart the UK economy. But the World Health Organization has warned against these immunity passports because scientists are not sure whether people actually become immune after illness. In a statement the WHO said: 'There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.'\\xa0 Boris Johnson is expected to unveil his lockdown exit strategy in an address to the nation on Sunday, having delayed the announcement from Thursday as frantic work continues in Whitehall. Today it emerged that reduced hot-desking, the closure of office lifts and canteens, and putting tape on the floor to mark where people should stand are all likely to be proposed by the government under plans to restore office working.\\xa0 The NHS is rolling out its new coronavirus track-and-trace app today for testing across the Isle of Wight. Health and council workers will be asked to download the software on to smartphones to see if it works - and if phones can accurately trace personal contacts via bluetooth. But critics have questioned why the Government has chosen to collect the data of millions of people in one central system, rather than spreading the risk using a decentralised model adopted in Germany,\\xa0backed by tech giants Apple and Google.\\xa0 This is how the NHS app works - and the key differences between the UK's software and the Google-Apple app.   1. DOWNLOAD THE APP Britons will be able to download the app for free from the Department of Health website. It is also available via the Apple and Android app stores or via a link sent by email to NHS and public sector workers.\\xa0 It is being tested on the Isle of Wight before a potential roll-out across the country, probably one region at a time. 2. PROVIDE A PARTIAL POSTCODE To register the person will be asked to provide the first half of their postcode, which shows the NHS the town or borough they live in - but not their name or their exact home address. The user will be asked to allow the app to use the phone's bluetooth to keep track of other phones it comes close to and how long for.\\xa0 The NHS insists it will not be tracking location data - only phones. But while the Government has said 'your postcode will not be used to track your location' - it is less clear if they also mean your location will not be tracked at all. 3. KEEP YOUR PHONE ON  The user will be told to keep their phone and Bluetooth switched on at all times and the app will run in the background without them doing anything. The user will also be asked to allow 'push notifications' - which allows the NHS to send a person messages directly to their phones.\\xa0 When an individual goes out, the app will keep a log of every time it comes within Bluetooth range of another phone - but that person must also have the app.\\xa0 All IDs will be anonymous, with each app registered to a code rather than a person or address. 4. REPORT YOUR SYMPTOMS IF YOU BECOME ILL If someone becomes ill they will be asked to log on to the app and input it. They will be asked if they have the common symptoms of coronavirus such as a high temperature and a continuous cough. If no, nothing will happen. If yes, they will be told to order a coronavirus test. 5 APP SENDS YOUR DATA TO THE NHS SERVER FOR ANALYSIS BY EXPERTS If it is a suspected coronavirus case these symptoms and the anonymous IDs of all the phones the user has come into contact with are automatically sent to an NHS server. The NHS will analyse the data sent by the original sufferer using what it calls a ‘complex algorithm’. Although it is believed to be largely based on distance of between one and two metres, and the amount of time, probably around ten to 15 minutes.  6 NHS SENDS A TAILORED ALERT TO CONTACTS\\xa0\\xa0 It will then alert app users who have been in ‘significant contact’ with the original person with symptoms. The Department of Health has not revealed what the alerts will say. NHS analysts will write the alerts and they will be distributed by algorithm according to a contact's risk level. They could range from self isolate immediately to watch out for symptoms. The app will calculate how at risk a contact is by measuring their exposure to the person with symptoms. It will measure exposure by time and proximity. The NHS analysts will set the risk parameters that trigger alerts. 7. ORIGINAL SUFFERER CONTACTED BY HUMAN NHS CONTACT TRACERS The app will issue the original person with symptoms instructions on how to get a test using the software.\\xa0 One of around 10,000 UK human contact tracers may also get in contact on the phone and ask the app user how many people are in their household, where they have been and who they have been close to, that they know of, to find people who may not have been picked up by the bluetooth. They will also try to contact these new contacts if required.\\xa0 SUFFERER IS TESTED Once the Covid-19 test arrives at the person's home they will be expected to swab and then put it back in the post to an NHS testing centre. They may also be eligible for a home test by a health worker or visit one of the country's test centres. The result should be available within 48 hours. There are then two possible outcomes: •\\xa0 The person\\xa0tests negative. In this case, your contacts are told via a message that it was a false notification. • The person tests positive. In this case, your contacts are asked to isolate for 14 days, and get them into the clinical testing path.\\xa0 HUMAN CONTACT TRACERS CONTACT AT-RISK CONTACTS OF ORIGINAL SUFFERER AND PLOT HOTSPOTS The NHS' army of human contact tracers will contact app users who have been in ‘significant contact’ with the original person with symptoms will be alerted through the app. They will provided with ‘health advice’ – which may include self isolation – based on the NHS’ assessment of their level of risk. Not everyone who has been in contact will be alerted based on the NHS algorithm. This advice will be constantly modified by doctors based on the current sutuation.  If a hotspot of new cases emerges, the users will be advised to take more urgent action, such as staying at home or even seeking medical attention. The NHS team of contact tracers will then individually contact everyone who has been in contact with the sufferer, either through the app or by other means.\\xa0\\xa0 What are the differences between the NHS' 'centralised' app and the Apple-Google 'decentralised app'?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The app technologies developed by Google/Apple and the NHS are based on the same principle - they keep a log of who someone has come into close contact with. But the way they store data is the main difference.\\xa0 Britain has decided to develop an app with a 'centralised' system where smartphone data is sent to them - in Europe countries have gone for a less complex 'decentralised' system where the data is largely kept on their phones THE NHS APP IS CENTRALISED It keeps information of users who report symptoms and who they have been in contact with on centralised database on government servers. This lets NHS analysts access the data, analyse trends and contact people who are at risk. The data does not identify users, however privacy experts fear they could be unmasked by hackers. THE GOOGLE/APPLE APP IS DE-CENTRALISED It also keeps a log of the users contacts, but this information is always held within the app and is not uploaded to a government server. If a user reports symptoms, they report it to the app database. Other phones search the app database for users who have symptoms and they have been in contact with. The app alerts the government when users report symptoms but not who they have been in contact with. The alerts issued by the app or generic to all users and have no input from health officials. What are the differences in the way each app handles data? NHS app: Patient data and 'contacts' are sent to the Government's servers The NHSX app will create an alert every time two app users come within Bluetooth range of one another and log this in the user's phone. Each person will essentially build up a list of everyone they have been in 'contact' with. This will be anonymised so the lists will actually just be numbers or codes, not lists of names or addresses. If someone is diagnosed with the coronavirus or reports that they have symptoms, all the app users they got close to during the time that they were considered infectious - this will vary from person to person - will receive an alert telling them they have been put at risk of COVID-19 - but it won't name the person who was diagnosed. NHSX insists it will delete people's data when they get rid of the app and that data is deleted every 14 days. If the NHS collects the data it may be able to use it as part of wider contact tracing efforts as well as being able to detect local outbreaks using location data, also also send out warnings to people in specific areas. In future, if someone is diagnosed with COVID-19, members of an army of 18,000 'contact tracers' will be tasked with working out who else that patient has come into contact with and put at risk. It is not clear how much access the human contact tracers will have to data collected through the app. Apple/Google app: Most patient data is contained on phones  In Apple and Google's de-centralised approach, meanwhile, the server and list element of this process is removed and the entire log is contained in someone's phone. That app works by exchanging a digital 'token' with every phone someone comes within Bluetooth range of over a fixed period. If one person develops symptoms of the coronavirus or tests positive, they will be able to enter this information into the app. The phone will then send out a notification to all the devices they have exchanged tokens with during the infection window, to make people aware they may have been exposed to COVID-19. The server database will not be necessary because each phone will keep an individual log of the bluetooth profiles someone has come close to. These will then be linked anonymously to people's NHS apps and alerts can be pushed through that even after the person is out of bluetooth range. It is understood that if someone later deletes the Google/Apple app and closes their account their data would be erased. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each app? Advantages of the NHS centralised app:\\xa0  Disadvantages of the NHS centralised app:\\xa0 Advantages of Apple/Google de-centralised apps:\\xa0 Disadvantages of Apple/Google decentralised apps:\\xa0 Could the NHS app be illegal? Lawyers have also suggested that the NHS' new app may breach the\\xa0The Human Rights Act 1998 and the Data Protection Act 2018 - therefore making it unlawful. Leading barrister Matthew Ryder, a QC at Matrix Chambers in London, has warned it could be illegal and suggested it is 'inevitable' the nationwide rollout of the app could be challenged in the High Court.\\xa0 Mr Ryder says the app needs a full Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) - a process to help identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project. A DPIA is only required for a project likely to result in a high risk to individuals. These are overseen by Britain's data watchdog - the Information Commissioner's Office. He told the BBC:\\xa0'The government needs to justify why they are going for the system that has a greater interference than the one that should do the job with less interference. 'If Germany, the US and Italy can all do the job that we want to do with a decentralised system that Apple and Google have facilitated, which is the least interference of privacy, we need to understand why the UK thinks it can't do the job and needs a different system.\\xa0 'What the Information Commissioner said that we agree with is that there needs to be a data impact assessment. So that the information commissioner and everyone else can understand what the data impact assessment is and why the NHS thinks they need these extra interferences with\\xa0our privacy in order to be able to do the job. This is a really important thing and we need to protect rights'. He added:\\xa0'It's almost inevitable that if the Government doesn't take the approach that the information commissioner and others are suggesting, hopefully they will, then are going to be legal implications including the possibility of a legal challenge. '\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Will the app drain my battery?\\xa0 Developers insist that shouldn't empty a phone's battery - and should only have the same impact as an Apple watch, which should only take a matter of minutes off the average battery life each day. The app automatically searches for nearby phones that are using the same app by using Bluetooth Low Energy. This will only send information at around 200\\xa0kilobits per second.\\xa0 Whereas normal bluetooth used around three megabits per second, more than ten times as much. What happens if someone fakes coronavirus as\\xa0a prank?\\xa0 The system relies on honesty - but the NHS believes any foul play can be rooted out and set right. The Government will be using thousands of human tracers who will contact people after they use the app to declare Covid-19 symptoms.\\xa0If they continue the charade they will be asked to take a test - which will either be ignored or come back negative. Health workers will have the means to send messages to potential contacts telling them it is a false alarm.The ploy will, however, waste time and money for the NHS as they try to identify genuine cases.\\xa0 Contact tracing is seen as one of several possible remedies to help the UK out of lockdown and an app trial is now ready to go. Here's out it will work: What is contact tracing? Contact tracing is a way of tracking social networks around people so that when one of them gets diagnosed with COVID-19 the rest of them can be alerted that they might be at risk. This is intended to stop people passing on the virus without realising they might be infectious. The British Government is working on an army of 18,000 human contact tracers who will question COVID-19 patients, as well as the app which will log connections in the background. Why is the trial being done on the Isle of Wight?\\xa0 The app is being trialled on the Isle of Wight because it is a small, self-contained community which is easier to control, Mr Hancock said.\\xa0 He claimed it could be tested in 'proper scientifically-controlled conditions' there because people cannot come and go freely\\xa0- there is no bridge or tunnel between the Isle and mainland Britain. It will be easier for officials to get a clear idea of what proportion of the population has downloaded the app, and to get tests for large parts of communities quickly.\\xa0\\xa0 How will the app work? Once installed and set up, the app will run in the background, keeping a log of everyone you pass. Users will need to provide the first part of their postcode and give the app permission to use Bluetooth, as well as its ability to receive notifications. Bluetooth will need to be kept on. When a person is feeling unwell, they need to send a report, stating whether they are experiencing a high temperature and a continuous cough, and when these symptoms started. If it appears they might have the virus, the person will be told to book a test. The information is then uploaded, along with the last 28 days of proximity events, and fed into a complex at-risk algorithm which crunches data such as distance, duration and symptoms. It will only notify those deemed at risk to isolate for 14 days and ask them monitor their symptoms. If the person's results come back as negative, those who came into contact with them will be told they are able to come out of isolation. But should the result be positive, the person will be told to self-isolate for seven days, while those who came into contact with them continue self-isolating and book a test of their own if they have slightest symptom.\\xa0 What will constitute close enough contact for someone to be warned?\\xa0\\xa0 The Department of Health said a 'complex risk algorithm' will be used to dictate who has been in close enough contact for them to be warned. It is not clear how this is calculated. The World Health Organization's rule is someone is at risk if they have spent 15 minutes within six-and-a-half feet (2m), but the level of contact may change this. For example, physical contact is likely to require less exposure time than car-sharing to produce the same risk. Will the contract tracing app be effective and when will the rest of the UK get it? The app was first tested on staff at RAF Leeming, and air base in North Yorkshire, where trials 'went well'. Contact tracing is really dependent on several crucial factors - though NHSX boss Matthew Gould has warned it will not be a 'silver bullet'. 'The app is exciting, but it's also not a silver bullet or a standalone solution, it's part of this wider strategy... it has to be seen as part of this strategy alongside the expansion of testing and human contact tracing,' he said. The app is also voluntary, so its effectiveness will rely on the amount of people actually using it. If it proves to be usable and uptake is good in the Isle of Wight trial, it is expected to roll out to the rest of the UK in mid-May, the Department of Health said. What if people don't record when they develop a cough? The app will rely on people being honest about when they think they have symptoms of the coronavirus, and what their test result is. These must be logged on the app by the user because the NHS will not link the app to patient records or even to someone's name. People who are dishonest about their health risk putting others at risk of COVID-19.

The government is facing a furious backlash at its draft 'road map' for starting to loosen the draconian curbs strangling the economy and plunging the country into debt. More people are set to be encouraged to edge back to work, with guidelines on how to minimise the risks. Other precautions will need to be in place if the two-metre social distancing rules cannot be maintained, while business will be told to\\xa0close canteens, stagger shift patterns, spread out offices and stop people sharing equipment.\\xa0 But unions and Labour are demanding much tougher protections, suggesting that otherwise people could simply refuse to show up for work.\\xa0 The GMB said the guidance did 'not adequately protect workers - and as a result many may refuse to work to avoid putting themselves and their families at risk'.\\xa0 Rail unions have been particularly vocal in stating their members must not be put at risk on crowded trains without more guarantees from the government.\\xa0\\xa0 In a round of interviews this morning, Sir Keir lined up behind the warnings, saying the government must set a 'national safety standard'. 'This is not just a reassurance exercise for those going back to work, it's essential for the safety of the nation,' he said. 'If you don't have the protective equipment, and that means that people get infected, we're going to be right back where we started.' He insisted protective equipment for workers is not a 'luxury item' that would be 'nice to have'. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon dealt another blow to the UK's united front on coronavirus today, hinting that she will diverge from the Westminster government's policy. The Scottish First Minister said her 'overarching responsibility' was to represent interests north of the border, saying it was possible the outbreak was 'slightly' stronger there. She also unveiled her own 'exit strategy', days before Mr Johnson is due to, including proposals for people to be able to mix in 'bubbles' outside their own household. However, she insisted there is no prospect of the lockdown being eased this week.\\xa0 In other developments in the UK's coronavirus crisis:  Prime Minister Boris Johnson (pictured in Whitehalll today) will unveil the 'exit strategy' to the nation on Sunday, although there is only expected to be a marginal loosening of the lockdown  In a round of interviews this morning, Sir Keir Starmer lined up behind the warnings from unions, saying the government must set a 'national safety standard'\\xa0 Coronavirus survivors will 'almost certainly' not obtain 'absolute immunity' from a second illness naturally, the Government's chief scientific adviser warned this morning. Sir Patrick Vallance told MPs that the vast majority of those who manage to beat the disease build up anti-bodies that attack it in the body and will get 'some degree of protection'. But he admitted that work is still ongoing around the world into the level of protection it affords - showing the need for a viable vaccine to be developed. It comes as the Government comes under increasing pressure to ease the social end economic lockdown on Britain. But ministers are keen to avoid a second peak of infections by making sure the 'R' infection rate. stays below 1.\\xa0 Appearing in front of the Health and Social Care Committee this morning he also said scientists have yet to discover whether survivors who get a second dose can pass it on to those around them, even if they do not become ill again themselves. Describing the\\xa0 science on antibody protection as 'promising;' he said: 'Everything suggests you can get neutralising antibodies, those are antibodies which protect against the disease.\\xa0 'So you would expect some degree of protection from antibodies. We don't know that it provides absolute immunity and it almost certainly doesn't - it will provide some degree of protection. 'The other thing we don;'t know is whether it is still possible to carry the virus even if you have got antibodies.\\xa0 'So that is more about whether you can still be infectious to someone else rather than whether you are protected against it.' Giving a potential timeframe for immunity based on experience from other coronaviruses, he said: 'It may last for one, two, three years, but not for many, many years.'\\xa0 \\xa0 The government is believed to have warned industry groups that the restrictions could stay in place for six to 12 months - dashing hopes of a swift return to normal life.\\xa0 Under the plans, shift will be staggered to limit the number of people at work at any one time and reduce rush-hour pressure on public transport. Access to communal facilities like photocopiers will be limited, areas of the floor will be taped off to keep people two metres apart and people could be barred from sitting opposite one another. Hot desking will be banned and workers will not even be allowed to lend each other a pen for fear of spreading the virus. As a result of the stringent measures, millions of staff will be told to keep working from home indefinitely 'if at all possible'. And firms have been told that 'vulnerable' people, including the over-70s, pregnant women and the severely obese, should work from home – even if this means finding them a new role.\\xa0 In his interviews, Sir Keir said:\\xa0'I sense that people are really worried about lifting of lockdown. They're really worried about going back to work. They need a high level of reassurance.' He said a national consensus would give 'a degree of confidence', adding: 'The point that trade unions have raised is safety at work and there was a consultation document the government put out last weekend which was pretty vague, and it needs strengthening. 'That's why one of the principles I've set out today is a national safety standard. 'I think people will want to know if I'm going back to work, is it a safe environment, what's being done about social distancing, what are the hand-washing facilities, if I need protective equipment am I going to get it? 'It's that degree of reassurance.'\\xa0\\xa0 Amid a wave of criticism from unions, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Throughout this crisis the TUC has sought to engage constructively with ministers. But we cannot support the Government's back-to-work plans as they stand. 'We want new binding rules for employers to publish their risk assessment and action plan. We want clear guidance to set out the minimum standards that employers must meet in order to protect public safety. And we want ministers to outline a new tough approach to enforcement. 'Unless the Government significantly strengthens its plans, safe working will not be guaranteed. The current proposals fail to provide clear direction to those employers who want to act responsibly. And they are an open goal for rogue employers, who will cut corners and put their workers - and the wider community - at risk. 'We urge ministers to work with the TUC and unions to ensure people can make a safe return to work.' Prospect union general secretary Mike Clancy said: 'If the economy is to recover sustainably and safely then a return to work must be managed properly. 'The question is how the advice from Public Health England is grounded in relevant evidence. The Government must provide absolute clarity on how workplaces can operate safely, and it must set out the evidence for its advice. 'We all want to get back to work, but there is no point in easing the lockdown if the guidelines put people at risk, potentially causing a spike in cases and another full-scale lockdown,' he added. There was still heavy traffic on the A102 in Greenwich this morning despite the government's lockdown instructions Commuters on the Tube in London this morning have little chance of obeying the 'social distancing' guidelines to stay two metres apart The risk of catching coronavirus increase by up to 30 times if you go from two to one metres from a sufferer, Sir Patrick Vallance has warned. It comes amid moves to get offices back to work, possible by relaxing the current\\xa0 social distancing rule within workspaces.\\xa0 Defence Secretary Ben Wallace yesterday said that firms would be allowed to break the two-metre rule on social distancing where it was unavoidable. But he suggested that other precautions, such as plastic screens, might have to be installed in workplaces.  However, Sir Patrick, the Government's chief scientific adviser, told the Commons Health Committee this morning (above):\\xa0'The evidence is, as far as you can get very firm evidence on this, that essentially a minute at two metres\\xa0 ...\\xa0 is about the same risk as six seconds at one metre. 'So that gives you some idea of why the two metres becomes important. 'And the risk at one metre is about 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at two metres. 'So the distancing is an important part of this.' John Phillips, acting general secretary of the GMB Union, said: 'We desperately need to get the economy going and nobody is keener than GMB to get people back to work - but this guidance was thrown together in a hurry and it shows. 'Giving unions and employers just 12 hours to respond is not good enough and means crucial changes will not be made. We cannot endorse crucial guidance if it is incomplete. 'The guidance has to be clear on how safe working practice is to be enforced. 'As it stands, there is nothing on PPE, nothing on enforcement to ensure workplaces are safe and nothing giving workers the assurances they need to get back to their jobs.'\\xa0 The general secretaries of 10 teaching unions across the UK and Ireland have written to the education ministers in all five jurisdictions urging 'significant caution in any consideration of reopening schools'. The letter, sent by the British and Irish Group of Teachers' Unions (BIGTU) on behalf of teachers, warns of the 'very real risk of creating a spike in the transmission of the virus by a premature opening of schools'. It says: 'We are convinced by the experience of other systems that a critical tool in preventing a surge of infection is an established capacity to 'test, trace and isolate' and we would argue that reopening schools before such a regime is in place would be catastrophic to the rate of infection.' The coalition of union leaders argues that schools can only reopen and operate safely if there are 'significant operational changes' in place to ensure effective social distancing, as well as strong hygiene routines and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) where required. 'We would urge that the initial focus when schools reopen, in any capacity, should be on the health, wellbeing, and emotional resilience of our students,' it adds. The letter follows speculation that schools could be asked to reopen their doors to more pupils before the summer holidays. The businesses were told in the consultation document that there will be a 'gradual winding down' of the restrictions after the winter. The warnings of a year under restrictions are thought to have been influenced by fears among government medical advisers that the coronavirus is seasonal.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 An industry source said: 'If it survives the winter, these measures will have to be in place longer.' Other measures introduced will include\\xa0safety\\xa0guidance for 'in-home workers', including cleaners, cooks\\xa0 and plumbers, as well as people offering services like fitness trainers.\\xa0\\xa0 For example, companies should provide the same cleaner to the same house where possible and delivery companies should call residents rather than ringing the doorbell.\\xa0  The measures will also encourage taxi drivers to use contactless payment where possible.\\xa0 Meanwhile, retailers have been told to ask customers to 'shop alone' to prevent queues when high street stores finally reopen. But there is no sign of any return for pubs and restaurants, except those offering takeaway services. The plans will form a central plank in the Government's proposals for the 'second phase' of the coronavirus crisis, which are set to be unveiled by Boris Johnson at the weekend. Last night however, ministers were on a collision course with trade unions over the proposals, with leaders warning that staff could be ordered to down tools unless their safety is guaranteed. Transport unions said that drivers could refuse to resume train and bus services. One Government source said the opposition of the unions could be a 'major problem' in getting Britain back to work and ending the crippling lockdown that is costing the economy an estimated £2billion a day. However, businesses reserved judgment on the proposals, with bosses saying the plans did not reflect real life and lacked information about the kind of protective equipment staff will need. Government sources last night indicated that ministers are set to roll over the lockdown for another three weeks when they review it on Thursday. The Prime Minister will then outline a 'comprehensive' plan to get Britain moving again at the weekend. But the leaked documents on the planned return to work confirm that the 'new normal', as described by ministers, will bear little resemblance to our old life. In a video message yesterday, the PM suggested any lifting of restrictions will be very gradual, saying: 'The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of coronavirus.' In the Commons, several Tory MPs urged a faster lifting of the lockdown. Sir Charles Walker warned Britain would suffer 'a tidal wave of human misery' if thousands of good firms were allowed to go to the wall.      Tory shop steward Sir Graham Brady urged ministers to act 'with a view to removing restrictions and removing these arbitrary rules and limitations on freedom as quickly as possible'.\\xa0 But speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference last night, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the first aim was to 'protect the NHS so the NHS is always there to protect you and your family.'\\xa0 Under the Government's plans, all firms employing more than five people will have to draw up a detailed risk assessment of working conditions. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace yesterday said that firms would be allowed to break the two-metre rule on social distancing where it was unavoidable. But he suggested that other precautions, such as plastic screens, might have to be installed in workplaces. However, the draft documents give few details to employers or unions, saying only that guidance on PPE 'is to follow'. The country could also see handwashing kits by doors, one-way systems in offices, train platforms and bus stops, and limits on the number of people in shops - many of which will go cashless.\\xa0 Public transport stations would have two metre markers to keep social distancing, with one-way systems to prevent unnecessary contact.   London Mayor Sadiq Khan said public transport was already at the 'maximum' available capacity, with room for only 15 per cent of normal passenger numbers. The Institute for Fiscal Studies will today call on ministers to offer subsidies and tax breaks to encourage working from home. The independent think-tank also warns that peak fares might have to be increased to try to reduce overcrowding in the rush hour. Business leaders called for clarity on issues such as PPE and whether firms can be held liable even if they fulfil their obligations to protect employees. Director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce Adam Marshall said bosses 'will want to know that they're not going to be held liable for horrible things that may unfortunately happen if they've done everything in their power to keep their people safe'.

The Government wants hospitals to treat people in crucial need of medical help. But, because of the virus, operating theatres have been mothballed and wards closed. For those who wait, the dreadful truth is that help may come too late.

She said: 'We send our very best wishes to you Piers and promise to be on our best behaviour while you are not here.' Speaking on this morning's show, TV doctor Hilary Jones explained that\\xa0Mr Morgan does not have symptoms consistent with Covid-19 but has taken a test and is remaining off the show as a precaution.\\xa0 Mr Morgan had previously announced on Twitter that he would not be on the show today after feeling unwell over the weekend. Ben Shephard and Susanna Reid (pictured) are hosted Good Morning Britain today in Piers' absence The presenter (left with co-host Susanna Reid) has been one of the strongest voices holding the government to account throughout the crisis He had been going into the west\\xa0London studio every morning, doing his own make-up and sitting two metres away from co-host Susanna Reid. Mr Morgan tweeted on Sunday night: 'UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs, I've had a test for COVID-19 and so won't be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow.'\\xa0 He received a number of messages of support on Twitter, including Mr Hancock. Mr Hancock said: 'Sorry to see Piers Morgan has symptoms of coronavirus. 'If you test positive, I sincerely hope it’s mild. Get well soon.' Mr Morgan's scare comes after co-host Ms Reid self-isolated at her London home for two weeks in March following a member of her household developing symptoms of the bug. Ben Shepard, Susanna Reid and doctor Hilary Jones discussed Mr Morgan's health on Good Morning Britain this morning Mr Morgan, who is usually on the show with Ms Reid from Monday to Wednesday, has been one of the strongest voices holding the government to account during the crisis. Since the country was put in lockdown on March 23, he has become the interviewer ministers fear most due to his ruthless scrutinising of the facts. He has spoken truth to power at every turn, including fiercely questioning decisions made by both the UK and US governments. In an article for MailOnline on Thursday, the columnist branded Prime Minister Boris Johnson's first press briefing back after beating Covid 'complete and utter bullsh*t'. He said Mr Johnson's speech had made US President Donald Trump seem credible and that his Brexit strategy cannot be used to beat the virus. Mr Morgan wrote: 'When Boris fans, the vast majority of them with union jack flags and Brexit slogans in their profiles, scream abuse at me all day long on Twitter for challenging their hero's coronavirus strategy, they do so because to them, any criticism of the government over this crisis is a re-run of the viciously toxic and partisan Brexit campaign.'  He added: 'None of Boris Johnson's political skills that won him the Referendum and December's election are working like they did before the virus struck.' The journalist pointed to a chart that was shown at the end of the briefing on the\\xa0'Global Death Comparision'. He spotted how it showed the UK was trending to be the second worst hit country in the world for Covid-19 deaths. On Sunday the number of fatalities in Britain rose by\\xa0315 to\\xa028,446, putting it on course to become the hardest hit in Europe. Its toll is now 264 behind Italy - the continent's original epicentre - which it will likely overtake tomorrow to suffer the second highest fatalities in the world after the US. Mr Johnson was not the only world leader Mr Morgan has targeted, with him going toe-to-toe with President Trump over the US's coronavirus strategy. The presenter has repeatedly called out Mr Trump's approach to the bug, which has rampaged across the US and killed more than 65,000 people. The presenter has repeatedly called out Mr Trump's (pictured on Sunday) approach to the bug, which has rampaged across the US and killed more than 65,000 people This culminating in him saying Mr Trump was 'batsh*t crazy' for his handling of the crisis. The US President faced widespread ridicule after he suggested tackling coronavirus with the use of 'powerful' UV light or even injecting patients with disinfectant.\\xa0 Starting his column by telling Mr Trump to 'shut the f*** up', Mr Morgan admonished the President for using his position to air the 'batsh*t crazy theories'. The presenter later announced Mr Trump had unfollowed him on Twitter. Mr Morgan's approach to politicians was vindicated last week when OFCOM\\xa0 cleared him for his 'combative' style. The GMB host attracted more than 3,000 complaints from two interviews with care minister Helen Whately on the show last month. Almost 600 viewers also complained about another interview with Health Secretary Matt Hancock on April 16. But Ofcom said: 'It is clearly in the public interest that broadcasters are able to hold those making political decisions to account.' Mr Morgan grilled Ms Whately about the number of NHS and care workers who have died from Covid-19 and accused her of 'massively understating' the effects of the virus. In the interview Mrs Whately claimed 76 NHS and care workers had died from the disease, to which the host replied: 'You see these numbers again, are completely wrong. Care Minister Helen Whately (right) was on the receiving end of two of the journalist's (left) most memorable displays within the space of a week last month 'The real figure of all the people who work in the NHS and care homes who have died is actually 111.' Mr Hancock was challenged by the MailOnline columnist on whether he would volunteer for a salary reduction. During the exchange on April 16, Morgan was also angered when the politician claimed the Government was prepared for the pandemic, telling him: 'Stop playing that game with me, Mr Hancock. You're buying yourself a bit of time.' Mr Morgan said he would have 'admired' Mr Hancock more if he would have just admitted that the Department of Health 'had not been prepared' for the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the National Health Service. He added: 'Your resolute refusal to concede you made any mistakes here grates with me and misjudges the public mood'. The pair continued to clash as Morgan chastised Mr Hancock, reminding him he runs the show after the politician urged him to 'let him speak', during the interview. On Good Morning Britain Mr Morgan said of the watchdog investigation: 'They have not held up any of the complaints. I'm glad about that. 'Freedom of speech matters and journalists doing their job matters. Getting the government to think about every decision they are taking matters, holding them to account matters. 'We do our job they do theirs. But we are all on the same side here and we shouldn't mistake challenging government's with wanting government to fail.\\xa0 'I want our government to succeed. We do this challenging everyday with ministers to help them make better decisions, so that fewer people die.\\xa0 'We are on the same side against the same enemy. It's not a referendum, its not an election, its one virus against the world.'

Mahan Air, a private company linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), is accused of lying about these passenger flights after Tehran barred all flights to China on January 31.\\xa0\\xa0 Arrival and departure data from Tehran's Imam Khomeini and Chinese airports shows that flights continued for another full week and into March, according to BBC News Arabic.\\xa0 One flight, a repatriation effort carried out for the government on February 6, brought 70 Iranian students living in Wuhan back to Tehran before flying to Baghdad the same day.\\xa0 Mahan Air, a private company linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), is also accused of concealing these flights, which included Wuhan, despite Tehran barring all flights to China on January 31 (file photo of a Mahan Air A310 landing at Dusseldorf, Germany, in 2015) China's ambassador to Iran, Chang Hua, posed with Mahan Air CEO Hamid Arabnejad on February 2 and noted that the boss had told him he wanted to keep working with China China's ambassador to Iran, Chang Hua, posed for a tweet with Mahan Air CEO Hamid Arabnejad on February 2 and noted that the boss had told him he wanted to keep working with China. Two days later\\xa0the semiofficial Iranian Students' News Agency slammed the ongoing flights.\\xa0 Mahan Air then claimed it had ended all flights from China on February 5, but travel to four major hubs (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) continued for another 55 times to February 23, Flightradar data showed. And on March 4, two weeks after Iran officially recorded its first deaths from COVID-19, Mahan Air was still flying to these Chinese cities, ForeignPolicy.com reported.\\xa0 The BBC's investigation found that the first cases in Lebanon and Iraq came from Mahan Air flights. Jets landing in Tehran from China also made onward travel within 24 hours to Barcelona, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul. Sources within Mahan Air told the BBC that cabin crew were kept quiet by the airline when they tried to raise concerns about the handling of the contagion and a lack of PPE.\\xa0 The airline claimed it had only flown cargo planes with humanitarian aid to China and that all of its passengers flights were grounded. However, the data shows these were passenger not cargo flights. Furthermore, Iran's severe lack of PPE and medical equipment makes it seem even more unlikely that it would fly humanitarian cargo to China. Indeed, by late March Beijing had sent medics to Iran to help with the crisis.\\xa0 Mahan Air claimed it had ended all flights from China on February 5, but it had continued travel to four major hubs, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, another 55 times by February 23, Flightradar data showed Iranian president Hassan Rouhani speaks during the cabinet meeting in Tehran on May 3 Tehran had downplayed reports of the virus and\\xa0President Hassan Rouhani has said February 19 was the first time the government knew coronavirus was in the country. However, at least one leaked dossier\\xa0purports to refer to cases in Qom in January, but social distancing measures were not put in place until after the February 21 general election. Qom, the epicentre for the disease in Iran, is suspected of becoming the ground zero due to Chinese students who attend the university in the city, which has some 400,000 immigrant students. Mahan Air has refused to comment. The coronavirus death toll in Iran rose by 74 on Monday to 6,277, while the total number of cases rose to 98,647. The daily death toll has stayed below 100 since mid-April (pictured:\\xa0People wearing protective clothing attend the funeral of a victim who died from the new coronavirus, at a cemetery in the outskirts of the city of Babol, in north of Iran) Relatives of a victim who died from the new coronavirus, mourn at the gate of a cemetery, in the outskirts of the city of Babol, in north of Iran, Thursday, April 30 The airline has been sanctioned by Washington for helping to transport IRGC personnel and arms to Bashar al-Assad in Syria. And more recently it repatriated the body of slain IRGC commander General Qassem Soleimani, after he was blown up by a US missile outside Baghdad airport in the New Year. The coronavirus death toll in Iran rose by 74 on Monday to 6,277, while the total number of cases rose to 98,647. The daily death toll has stayed below 100 since mid-April.\\xa0 Iran was due to open mosques in 132 cities and towns on Monday, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, part of a broader plan to ease restrictions. It was not immediately clear how many reopened. The 132 cities and towns were chosen because they were deemed low-risk and have not had new coronavirus infections or deaths for a period of time.\\xa0 \""

       "'the uks test track and trace coronavirus strategy is being rolled out  with the national health services allimportant app finally live people on the isle of wight are being asked to download it to smartphones in a pilot test of how well it works  the app is designed to alert people to possible exposure to coronavirus and is part of the governments threepart plan which will shape how and when the uk leaves lockdown  the strategys three aims are the three parts closely relate to each other  with experts saying success depends on all elements working together  the government met its target of  tests a day by the end of april  but this figure included testing kits sent out by post  actually daily tests have dropped back to around  per day since then only the following people and groups can register for an nhs test they will either receive a test at home  or be asked to go to a drivethrough testing site  the government has also promised mobile units and further facilities on nhs premises the test involves swabbing inside the nose and at the back of the throat with a special cotton bud  couriers then take the swabs for analysis  three megalabs in glasgow milton keynes and cheshire are processing tens of thousands of tests a day  results should be sent back within  hours  or  hours for home kits the government is recruiting  households across the uk to be regularly tested for coronavirus   with ministers hoping to ultimately have  taking part  volunteers will be tested every week for the first five weeks and then every month for a year  they will also answer more detailed questions from a health worker some will also be tested for antibodies  this is the evidence of immunity to coronavirus following infection  the study should provide crucially important data on how coronavirus is moving through the population  and the results will influence decisions on social distancing and lockdowns  it is being run by the department for health and the office for national statistics with advice from university of oxford scientists and support from data science company iqvia uk and the national biosample centre in milton keynes the nhss digital research division nhsx has developed a smartphone app now being tested on the isle of wight  it alerts people potentially exposed to someone with coronavirus the app uses bluetooth  a radio technology that connects devices close to each other  as users come close to another persons phone the app registers the other phones presence  if an app user develops coronavirus symptoms they register those with the app  and it then alerts those other app users in theory that means they receive an early warning they may have been infected epidemiologist prof christophe fraser who has worked on the app told bbc news the aim was to link the system to results from tests for even more accurate coverage of the population  less than a fifth of singapores population are believed to have installed its version of a tracing app  meaning its success has been difficult to measure  similar concerns have been raised in other countries if you your friends relatives and colleagues install the app you have a group of people who are protected said prof fraser for this intervention alone to control an epidemic you would need about  of the population to download and adhere to it  on the other hand were not proposing that this system should work alone if this intervention is sitting alongside other methods you would need a lower uptake the app does not disclose personal details to other users  but the information commissioner the uks data protection watchdog says the details gathered in the phones should not be centralised  other experts have warned apps could lead to false alerts of infection because the bluetooth technology could link phones belonging to people who were in fact a safe distance apart  apple google and others have proposed a different system where data is decentralised and processed by users phones backers of this system say it gives users more control over their data  the nhs says a centralised system gives more insight into where the virus is spreading and how well the app is performing alongside the app the government is recruiting  tracers  they will interview people who test positive to find out whom they have definitely been close to  such as family neighbours or colleagues  these contacts can then be explicitly advised to selfisolate because of the high risk they are infected giving the virus less chance to spread  an nhs app that aims to track the spread of coronavirus is being rolled out for the first time as part of a trial on the isle of wight council and healthcare workers will be the first to try the contacttracing app with the rest of the island able to download it from thursday if the trial is successful it could be available nationwide within weeks concerns have been raised over privacy though ministers say the app has been designed with this front of mind the app aims to quickly trace recent contacts of anyone who tests positive for the virus it is part of the governments strategy for coming out of lockdown which aims to have widespread testing and contact tracing in place to monitor and reduce any future outbreaks if the trial is successful the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of may health secretary matt hancock said meanwhile labour leader sir keir starmer has called for a national consensus on tackling the virus when the uk begins to move out of lockdown it comes as the the number of coronavirusrelated deaths in the uk reached  an increase of  the daily increase in deaths is lower than at any point since the end of march but the figures reported at the weekend tend to be lower and are expected to rise mr hancock said  the new app  published on apple and googles app stores  works by using a bluetooth connection  it records when two people who have the app are within a certain distance of each other for longer than a specified amount of time if one of those people later reports having symptoms all the other app users they came into significant contact with over recent days will be alerted and if judged necessary told to selfisolate the exact advice on what you should do will depend on the evolving context and approach the nhs has said read more here mr hancock urged everyone on the isle of wight to download the app when it was available to them social distancing rules would still be in place during the trial he said by downloading the app you are protecting your own health you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community he said where the isle of wight goes britain follows the island was chosen for the trial because it has a lower number of new infections is covered by a single nhs trust and because travel to and from the island is quite restricted mr hancock told bbc breakfast the app would be an incredibly important part of the fight against the virus and the more people who downloaded it the more lockdown restrictions could be eased  sir keir said he hoped the app would be successful but questioned whether takeup would be high enough  i am a bit concerned that a similar app in singapore only had i think something like a  takeup rate in the public he told bbc radio  today programme  the labour leader added that traditional methods of tracing for example phoning people would have to be used alongside the technology  the centralised model of the app   meaning there is a central computer server which works out which phones have matched  has raised some privacy concerns  this is different to the decentralised model used by apple and google where the matches take place on users handsets some have argued a centralised approach gives the app advantages for example by making it easier to spot hotspots where the disease is spreading but others say a central system increases the risk from potential hackers law professor orla lynskey said the option on the app for users to opt in and share their location data poses a big risk but nhsx  the part of the health service that developed the app  said the app will be voluntary and the only personal data stored by the app at the start would be the first part of the users postcode additional location data will only be recorded if users agree to a further optin request nhsx added mr hancock said the software was designed with privacy and security front of mind he said the data was stored on the phone and only sent to the nhs when someone needs a test the uks test track and trace strategy has seen testing be scaled up over the last month following mr hancocks pledge to reach  tests by the end of april the uk passed the target providing more than  tests on the last day of april latest figures show there were  tests on sunday meanwhile the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage which has been advising the government on the pandemic has published some of the evidence which informed its guidance the documents cover the groups meetings up to  april  among the papers published by sage is one from a meeting on 2 april which suggests lockdown restrictions should be eased very gradually to avoid measures needing to be reintroduced which could undermine public trust  in other developments  how have you been affected by coronavirus  are you taking part in the trial of the contact tracing app you can share your experience by emailing haveyoursaybbccouk please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a bbc journalist  more than  people have died with  but there are still no drugs proven to help doctors treat the disease  so how far are we from these lifesaving medicines more than  different drugs are being researched around the world most are existing drugs that are being trialled against the virus there are three broad approaches being investigated the latest clinical trials of remdesivir an antiviral drug originally developed to treat ebola have been encouraging  the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid found that remdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from  days down to  the trials involved  people at hospitals around the world some were given the drug and others were given a placebo dummy treatment dr anthony fauci who runs niaid said that remdesivir had a clearcut significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery however although remdesivir may aid recovery  and possibly stop people having to be treated in intensive care  the trials did not give any clear indication whether it can prevent deaths from coronavirus  it is thought that antivirals may be more effective in the early stages and immune drugs later in the disease it is one of the four drugs in the who solidarity trial and its manufacturer gilead is also organising trials the us data on remdesivir was published at the same time as a trial of the same drug in china reported in the lancet medical journal showed it was ineffective however that trial was incomplete because the success of lockdown in wuhan meant doctors ran out of patients there has been much talk but little evidence that a pair of hiv drugs  lopinavir and ritonavir  would be effective at treating coronavirus  there has been some evidence they can work in the laboratory but studies in people have been disappointing the combination did not improve recovery reduce deaths or lower levels of the virus in patients with serious   however as the trial was conducted with extremely sick patients nearly a quarter died it may have been too late in the infection for the drugs to work  malaria drugs are part of both the solidarity and recovery trials  chloroquine and a related derivative hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral and immunecalming properties  the drugs have been thrust into the spotlight as potential coronavirus therapies largely due to claims made by president trump but there is still scant evidence on their effectiveness  hydroxychloroquine is also used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis because it can help regulate the immune system laboratory tests have shown it can inhibit the coronavirus and there is some anecdotal evidence from doctors saying it appears to help patients  however the who says there is no definitive evidence of its effectiveness  if the immune system overreacts to the virus then it can cause inflammation throughout the body this is helpful for rallying the immune system to fight the infection but too much can cause collateral damage throughout body and can be fatal the solidarity trial is investigating interferon beta which is used to treat multiple sclerosis and lowers inflammation interferons are a group of chemicals released by the body when under attack by a virus the uks recovery trial is investigating dexamethasone  a type of steroid used to reduce inflammation people who survive an infection should have antibodies in their blood that can attack the virus  the idea is you take the blood plasma the part which contains the antibodies and give that to a sick patient as a therapy  the us has already treated  patients with whats known as convalescent plasma and other countries are getting involved too it is too soon to know when we might have a drug that can treat the coronavirus however we should start to get the results of trials in the next few months this is much earlier than we will know if a vaccine which protects against infection rather than treat it is effective   this is because doctors are testing drugs that have already been developed and are known to be safe enough to use whereas vaccines researchers are starting from scratch some completely new experimental coronavirus drugs are also being tested in the laboratory but are not yet ready for human tests  the most obvious reason for wanting a treatment is it will save lives but it could also allow some lockdown measures to be lifted  having an effective treatment would in essence make coronavirus a milder disease  if it stopped people who were admitted to hospital from needing ventilation then there would be less risk of intensive care units being overwhelmed so controls on peoples lives may not need to be as strict if you are infected by coronavirus then for most people it would be mild and can be treated at home with bedrest paracetamol and plenty of fluids  but some people need more intensive hospital treatment which involves oxygen support such as ventilation follow james on twitter the middle east has many reasons to fear the coronavirus pandemic but it has one big advantage when it comes to resisting it most people in the region are young  a rough average is that at least  are under the age of  that makes them less susceptible to developing  the illness that has killed so many people in countries with older populations  most governments in the region saw what was happening elsewhere and had time to impose curfews and social distancing measures  but that is where the middle easts advantages end years of strife in the worlds least stable region have left weaknesses that the pandemic is sure to deepen medical capabilities vary widely the best hospitals in israel are as good as any in the world the healthcare systems in yemen syria and libya  never strong  have been severely damaged and in places destroyed by years of war  yemen was already in the grip the un said of the worlds worst humanitarian crisis now it has cases of  which could spread fast in impoverished overcrowded communities  aden in the south is in political turmoil even after two  deaths were announced last week local residents were reported to be ignoring a curfew still flocking to markets and mosques those same young people who have the best chance of resisting the virus were before it hit leading demonstrations against their governments  every country has its own grievances but in the arab middle east the protests have centred on corruption cronyism and reform corrupt elites are accused of siphoning off public money that should have gone into public services not least hospitals  in algeria lebanon and iraq they forced out a president and two prime ministers protesters who refused to budge occupied the main squares of capital cities in iraq they stayed put even after around  protesters were shot dead and thousands more were wounded  young people who refused orders to clear the streets for months will not be enjoying the irony that the coronavirus has forced them indoors  when they emerge they will find the economies that failed miserably to generate jobs for them are now in even worse shape  the result will be more anger deepened but not created by the dangers and frustrations of this pandemic year leaders will have even fewer options  the global shutdown has already hurt middle eastern economies badly  in lebanon demonstrators left close to destitute by an economy that was in a state of collapse before the virus arrived have besieged and burnt banks  bigger players in the middle east will have to rethink ambitious sometimes dangerous always expensive foreign policies the days of buying influence and fighting proxy wars may be over lina khatib head of the middle east programme at the think tank chatham house believes regional powers like saudi arabia and iran will have to redo their calculations regarding the spread of their influence in the middle east they will be pushed to prioritise making sacrifices they would not have anticipated making in the past such as in yemen or syria she says  the economic consequences of the coronavirus are damaging everyone from oil billionaires in the gulf to day labourers in egypt  in poorer countries millions rely on the money they scrape together from day to day if they dont work during curfews they dont have money to buy food  iran is reopening its borders to trade after an outbreak that it reports has killed more than  of the  who have been infected the virus comes on top of renewed american sanctions that were already hammering irans economy  religious pilgrimages are a big part of some middle eastern economies  iraq losing billions of oil dollars also relies on millions of shia pilgrims mainly from iran in saudi arabia the city of mecca has been under curfew fully expecting the annual hajj pilgrimage in july to be cancelled  the collapse in oil prices mean huge drops in the income of countries that once looked financially impregnable  saudi arabias vastly expensive plans to diversify its economy no longer look affordable  algeria with  of its income from oil and gas is cutting public spending by a third algerias protest movement hirak suspended more than a year of weekly protests in march because of the virus but as the cuts bite they will be back the arab uprisings in  were powered by the anger of young people who believed their future was being stolen their hopes for change were mostly squandered or crushed but anger was smouldering again before the pandemic  the damage the virus is causing could create another political eruption  it was a matter of when not if an animal passed the coronavirus from wild bats to humans scientists say  but it remains unclear whether that animal was sold in the now infamous wuhan wildlife market in china the world health organization says that all evidence points to the viruss natural origin but some scientists now say it might never be known how the first person was infected  trade in wild animals is under scrutiny as source of this spillover but when wildlife is bought and sold in almost every country in the world controlling it  let alone banning it  is far from straightforward tackling it on a global scale could be the route to stopping a future pandemic before it starts  global health researchers have for many years understood how the trade in wild animals provides a source of speciestospecies disease transmission as lifechanging as this particular outbreak has been for so much of the global population it is actually one of many that the trade has been linked to  as the whos technical lead on  dr maria van kerkhove told the bbc we were preparing for something like this as its not a matter of if it is a matter of when infectious disease experts agree that like most emerging human disease this virus initially jumped undetected across the species barrier prof andrew cunningham from the zoological society of london explained weve actually been expecting something like this to happen for a while  these diseases are emerging more frequently in recent years as a result of human encroachment into wild habitat and increased contact and use of wild animals by people the virus that causes  joins a murky list of household name viruses  including ebola rabies sars and mers  that have originated in wild bat populations  some of the now extensive body of evidence about bat viruses and their ability to infect humans comes from seeking the source of the  outbreak of sars a very closely related coronavirus it was only in  though that scientists pinned down the rich gene pool of bat sarsrelated coronaviruses in a single cave in china  the possible source of the pandemic  these viruses have resided in the bodies of bats for millennia but are preprogrammed with the ability to infect a humans the key that unlocks some of our cells where they can replicate  in the case of sarscov2 the key is a virus protein called spike and the main lock to enter a cell is a receptor called ace2 explained prof david robertson a virologist from the university of glasgow the coronavirus is not only able to fit that ace2 lock its actually doing this many times better than sars1  does he said that perfect fit could explain why the coronavirus is so easily transmitted from person to person its contagiousness has outpaced our efforts to contain it but bringing the bat virus to the door of a human cell is where the trade in wildlife plays an important role most of us have heard that this virus started in a wildlife market in wuhan but the source of the virus  an animal with this pathogen in its body  was not found in the market the initial cluster of infections was associated with the market  that is circumstantial evidence explained prof james wood from the university of cambridge the infection could have come from somewhere else and just by chance clustered around people there but given that it is an animal virus the market association is highly suggestive prof cunningham agreed wildlife markets he explained are hotspots for animal diseases to find new hosts mixing large numbers of species under poor hygienic and welfare conditions and species that wouldnt normally come close together gives opportunities for pathogens to jump species to species he explained many wildlife viruses in the past have come into humans via a second species  one that is farmed or hunted and sold on a market prof woods explained the original sars virus was transmitted into the human population via an epidemic in palm civets which were being traded around southern china to be eaten that was very important to know because there was an epidemic in the palm civets themselves which had to be controlled to stop an ongoing spillover into humans in the search for the missing link in this particular transmission chain scientists found clues pointing to mink ferrets and even turtles as a host similar viruses were found in the bodies of rare and widely trafficked pangolins but none of these suspect species has been shown to be involved in this outbreak what we do know is that our contact with and trading of wild animals puts us in the path of new diseases that are silently seeking a host trying to make sure that we are not bringing wildlife into direct contact with ourselves or with other domestic animals is a very important part of this equation said prof wood   and there have been various campaigns to ban all trade in animals and all contact with wildlife he added but what you do then is penalise some of the poorest people in the world in many cases by introducing measures like that you drive trade underground which makes it far harder to do anything about the who has already called for stricter hygiene and safety standards for socalled wet markets in china but in many cases  such as the trade in bush meat in subsaharan africa which was linked with the ebola outbreak  markets are informal and therefore very difficult to regulate you cant do it from an office in london or in geneva you have to do that locally on the ground in every country added prof wood dr maria van kerkhove agreed its very important we work with population and people who are working at the animalhuman interface  people who work with wildlife what that will be is a truly global and highly complicated effort but the  outbreak appears to have shown us the cost of the alternative follow victoria on twitter'"

       "'vicki mckenna came to the ministry of healths offices with a warning  it was january  and mckenna president of the ontario nurses association and the organizations ceo were meeting with health minister christine elliott the nurses troubled by the unspooling news of how  had besieged the health care system in wuhan and was now popping up outside of china told the government that years of understaffing had left ontarios nursing homes just as vulnerable when we started to see what was happening in other jurisdictions the flags going up we asked ‘what are we doing about this are you acting on this mckenna said the minister she recalls listened to their concerns and said the province was monitoring the situation five days after that meeting the first case of  was identified in ontario over the next two months unions for frontline staff seniors advocates and longterm care experts say they continued to sound the alarm in conversations with both the ministry of health and ministry of longterm care they say the longterm care sector was overlooked as strained acute care resources were shored up in response to dire international reports of overwhelmed intensive care units  meanwhile the wellknown cracks in ontarios nursing home system were allowed to become deadly sinkholes according to experts and frontline staff as well as allegations made in court one hundred days since the provinces first  case the virus has killed  people   of them were nursing home residents  if not for ontarios flatfooted response in its nursing homes some of those deaths may have been averted  they listened but there was no action mckenna said until there were positive cases starting to percolate in longterm care thats when the light went on  and the focus turned to longterm care in late march as deaths inside nursing homes started to surge ford and his government vowed again and again to fortify the porous line of defence meant to protect ontarios most vulnerable from a virus that has them more than anyone in its crosshairs provincial and federal officials lamented how the viruss devastation of frail seniors was unprecedented and the country simply did not have a playbook for handling  in nursing homes but there were several playbooks  federal and provincial pandemic plans postsars reports and infection prevention and control guidelines  all painstakingly developed in preparation for the inevitable next pandemic they predicted that elderly people due to declining immune systems and multiple health conditions would be among the hardest hit and once inside a home the virus could spread fast higher transmission risk factors listed in the  canadian pandemic influenza preparedness planning guidance for the health sector include shared rooms shared bathrooms high nursetopatient ratios lack of space to isolate infected residents inability to have different staff for infected and uninfected residents and the inability to keep physical distance of two metres or more between residents many if not all of these factors were present at ontario longterm care homes especially in older facilities where up to four residents share a room given the risk for rapid spread and the highrisk population the stated goal of the plan for longterm care was to keep the facility or major areas of the facility completely free of influenza we knew exactly what was going to happen  we saw it in asia we saw it particularly in seniors in congregate care settings in italy and spain and then france said laura tamblyn watts ceo of canage a national seniors advocacy organization tamblyn watts said she has been part of a chorus of longterm care experts and frontline health care workers that for weeks had been calling for more aggressive meaningful government action to help halt the viruss wildfire spread through nursing homes we knew what was needed she continued the problem was the ontario government didnt do it in an emailed statement spokespersons for the ministry of health and ministry of longterm care said the focus of the province has been on ensuring that these homes have the resources they need including filling any urgent gaps the provinces increasingly stringent measures are building an iron ring around longtermcare homes so that we can protect our provinces most vulnerable the statement said the  virus is especially dangerous in part because of how it can sweep through society via silent spreaders who display no symptoms rendering normal screening measures focused on temperatures and symptoms far less useful while the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission was initially unclear experts say that once it was suspected ontario should have moved beyond symptom screening and closecontact testing to widespread testing in all longtermcare homes even without an outbreak  with regards to what could have been done  what were doing now but doing it a month ago would have prevented a lot of this said dr david fisman an epidemiologist at the university of torontos dalla lana school of public health jan  first  case in ontario in a memo on jan  chief medical officer dr david williams said the two initial cases a married couple who had returned from wuhan were not unexpected the risk to ontarians remained low but more cases were expected to arise among travellers at the start of february the ministry of health issued guidelines to longtermcare homes requesting passive screening of visitors staff and volunteers and active screening of residents signs instructed to selfidentify if they had travelled to china or had symptoms like fever or acute respiratory illness residents were to be monitored for fevers coughs or trouble breathing  it was only after the virus had ripped through some longterm care homes that they were able to move residents into single rooms because  had killed the previous occupant some frontline staff said mount sinai geriatrician dr nathan stall said the virus is estimated to kill about a third of infected longtermcare home residents  the nursing home sector was in crisis long before  said pat armstrong a sociology professor at york university and lead author of the canadian center for policy alternatives april  report reimagining longterm residential care in the  crisis longstanding staffing shortages stemmed from low pay and a reluctance to provide fulltime hours and benefits volunteers and family members have tried to fill the gaps  personal support workers primarily racialized and immigrant women who do the challenging work of bathing changing and feeding residents are forced to work at multiple homes to get enough hours the sectors increased reliance on parttime workers reduced workers awareness of infection protocols the  naylor report on the sars outbreak found and the hourly pay and lack of sick leave or benefits meant there was an incentive to work while ill  evidence from the battle against  overseas emerged early  by midfebruary chinas centre for disease control cdc released data showing the fatality rate for covid patients  years and older was  per cent more than six times larger than the death rate for the population as a whole by early march researchers in italy found that of  deaths the average age was  feb  the life care centre outbreak then came what former us centre for disease control director tom frieden called a sentinel event for north american nursing homes  the outbreak at life care center in kirkland washington  the first positive case was confirmed feb  just over a week later  residents were infected and  were dead  on march 8  the same day as the first death in canada at the lynn valley nursing home in vancouver  frieden pointed to the life care centre outbreak and called nursing homes ground zero for  he called for visits to be restricted and measures such as paid leave to ensure sick staff stay home it would be five days before ontarios chief medical officer of health advised nursing homes here to bar all but essential visitors with health officials focused on preparing hospitals for an onslaught of covid patients that could overwhelm intensive care units the province urged that certain covidnegative patients be transferred out of hospitals and into longterm care where they would be isolated for two weeks  our acute care system was inoculated as it were by sars and thats been really awesome said colin furness an infection control epidemiologist at the university of toronto but longterm care was not  it became pretty clear early that we werent ready said sharleen stewart the president of the service employees international union healthcare whose members work in nursing and retirement homes in meetings with officials from the ministries of health and longterm care through early march a lot of us brought up sars and it kind of just went without response we were asking the employers and the government particularly at that time ‘what was the personal protective equipment situation they said we had an adequate supply which was not what we were hearing on the front lines she said  protective gear was already in short supply at the end of january with some homes reporting they were unable to procure ppe from their usual supplier the province was not taking the risk to longterm care homes seriously enough she said the more i watched this and the more i looked back over the weeks and months of how this was handled i think this government chose who lives and dies i really do said stewart speaking the day after a memorial for a personal support worker who died from  march 8 first death in a longtermcare home in canada the day after the death of a resident at the lynn valley care home in north vancouver ontarios ministry of longterm care sent a memo instructing homes to actively screen all visitors and residents and advised staff to monitor for symptoms  in ontario the focus remained on travelrelated cases as the chief medical officer of health dr david williams assured the virus is not circulating locally on march  all returning travellers were told to self isolate with the exception of health care and essential workers two days later health workers were included but stewart said some employers were telling staff to get back to work if they werent showing symptoms and honestly thats when my hair caught fire its like im in the same world that theyre in and it was already talked about that that this was spread to asymptomatic people so once you have the symptoms its too late she said  by then cases of community spread were beginning to emerge march 9 is when the first residents at pinecrest nursing home in bobcaygeon likely became infected according to a letter written by a cardiologist in nearby lindsay in the ensuing weeks at least  residents of the ed home would die from the outbreak mississauga truck driver terence van dyke was glued to the news listening intently for anything about the home where just a little over a month earlier he had moved his father  eatonville care centre in etobicoke they werent on the news so i assumed they were doing things right van dyke said his father william had been living at a retirement home in simcoe worried that his fathers condition was worsening and that if he didnt pounce on the available bed his father would lose his spot in ontarios long queue for longterm care van dyke moved him to eatonville as he helped his dad settle into a cramped shared thirdfloor room van dykes heart sank when i left that day i cried i felt like i had taken him from the hilton and dropped him at a ramada inn he said the website for eatonville a forprofit home owned by rykka care centres offers only shared rooms some with as many as four beds these ward rooms common in older homes are tinderboxes for the transmission of viruses experts say there is simply no way to institute appropriate infection control tamblyn watts said inside eatonville sick residents were not properly separated from the healthy while staff were made to wear the same soiled protective gear while caring for all residents according to allegations filed in court by unions representing frontline health care workers a respiratory virus outbreak was declared on units 2 4 and 5 on march  according to submissions by the ontario nurses association the symptoms associated with the outbreak were consistent with a diagnosis of  residents on unit 3 also became symptomatic but were permitted to move about freely the ona alleged staff were given two masks at the start of each shift told to only put them on if caring for a patient with  and told to put the mask in their pocket at other times so that they were not walking the halls looking ‘suspicious  the nurse union alleges  at another rykkaowned nursing home staff used privacy curtains to mitigate the spread of  in shared rooms the ona took rykka to court where a judge ordered the company to make sure sick and healthy residents were properly segregated and staff did not cross between the groups and that nurses had access to highgrade  face masks if they deem it appropriate the judgment applies to three rykka homes including eatonville where covid outbreaks have claimed the lives of at least  residents in a separate complaint filed on behalf of two eatonville employees who caught covid the service employees international union seiu alleged to the ontario labour relations board that staff were not being told who was infected staff are being forced to ‘guess who is infected based on who is in isolation and who has a stop sign on their room doors the complaint alleges it seems that eatonville has been very lax with their preventative measures around  and has disregarded many of the prevention protocols that should have been put in place right away when the pandemic started evelyn macdonald the executive director of eatonville said in a statement that the home is using uptodate guidelines from public health and the chief medical officer of health on infection control best practices personal protective equipment standards and testing guidelines to mitigate covids spread inside the home in an affidavit filed in court macdonald said nurses had access to surgical masks and other protective equipment since the outbreak began in midmarch and have kept staff and residents families informed throughout the crisis during these challenging times we continue our efforts to protect our residents and staff by leveraging the best policies and practices available she told the star march  state of emergency on march  five days after premier ford declared a state of emergency shuttering schools libraries and sitdown meals in restaurants williamss office issued a directive barring residents from leaving nursing homes to see family or friends and that visits at the home had to be done with social distancing the directive also advised wherever possible homes would work with staff to limit the number of facilities they work at to minimize risk of patients to exposure to   this was only a recommendation and would not become a mandatory policy until a month later this was one of the ways that sars was getting between facilities said dr samir sinha head of geriatrics at mount sinai and the university health network so what did the sars commission say back in  we have to end that practice but we never did  because it would mean we had to fund the system better staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to the fatal outbreak at a washington nursing home a march  report by the us cdc concluded on march  in british columbia where officials believe the virus arrived at the lynn valley nursing home through a care worker with multiple employers the provincial health officer dr bonnie henry made an order limiting movement of staff at longterm care facilities the move was estimated to cost  million a month ontario did not order a halt to staff movement between homes for another twoandahalf weeks and the ban would take another week to come into force henrys actions may have charted a radically different course for bcs nursing homes compared to those in ontario they werent doing any better than we were doing in ontario in terms of their systemic issues said dr sinha ontario didnt act as decisively as bc in an emailed statement spokespersons for the ontario ministries of health and longterm care said the two provinces have very different longterm care sectors on march  ontario provided  million in emergency funding to support homes to rapidly hire and retain nurses personal support workers and other frontline staff as well as to create additional emergency capacity to support the isolating and cohorting of residents and staff as needed the same day henry took aggressive action sinha sent an email with a dire warning to the office of ontarios minister of seniors i fear that right now we are not getting ahead of this in ontario the way we need to reads the email a copy of which was obtained by the star sinha warned that the latest evidence showed symptombased screening might not capture covidpositive carriers who are asymptomatic or not yet showing symptoms  my bottom line  with  of the residents who tested positive were asymptomatic or presymptomatic once there is a case  everyone in a unithome should be tested all staff should be wearing ppe the letter said on march  the province continued to reject residencewide testing even in homes where there were outbreaks at a press conference that same day associate chief medical officer of health dr barbara yaffe said we dont want to use up the limited lab resources to test everybody when we already know what the cause of the outbreak is health officials changed their tone on april  part of the  action plan would now include aggressive testing of all residents in homes with outbreaks with plans to expand testing for longterm care residents and staff in the days following health officials dismissal of residencewide testing on march  until their changed approach on april  internal government data shows covid deaths in nursing homes grew from  to   an average daily jump in deaths of  per cent even though ontario did not have the capacity for widespread testing at first the strategy should have shifted sooner to test widely in longterm care homes in recognition of evidence of how fast and easily the virus spreads epidemiologist furness said  the virus was still running rampant through eatonville among those soon to be infected william vonnell van dyke  his son terence woke up around 9 am on april  and saw he had  missed calls from a number he did not recognize it was st josephs hospital where his father was now on oxygen within three hours his earold father was dead  he said he only found out that his father had tested positive for  from the funeral home director it was days more before he heard from anyone at eatonville  although the home was kind to his father van dyke questions why he was left in the dark and why his father was not tested sooner especially because he had developed a fever after returning from a hospital where he had surgery in midmarch as the death count continued to climb at eatonville and other longterm care homes van dyke said he spiralled further into grief i felt guilty because i put him there van dyke said sobbing all i could do  was look at a photo of my father and apologize april  fortifying the iron ring  when they look back on this when the history books are written we will be judged on how we looked out for each other but even more importantly we will be judged on who we looked after said premier doug ford in a sombre emotional press conference announcing the provinces plan to throw everything weve got at longterm care homes including hospital swat teams and more testing we will fortify the iron ring of protection around our longterm care residents and those who care for them ford said  toronto epidemiologist fisman says the viruss full impact on nursing homes cannot yet be known because there has not been enough testing there is also limited postmortem testing which means the death toll from the virus among seniors is likely undercounted although the widespread devastation inside ontarios nursing homes has exposed the repercussions of years of neglect and underfunding of longterm care seniors advocate tamblyn watts said she hopes it has also shone a spotlight on what needs to be fixed if one good thing comes out of this it will be a rethinking of how we provide seniors care and care for other vulnerable populations she said with files from moira welsh ottawa in late february jerry glubisz picked up a nasty bug going around in his vancouver office high fever brutal cough and unrelenting fatigue worst flu i ever had said the earold by the time a lab test confirmed  on mar  glubisz was already feeling  per cent better he didnt have to be hospitalized or put on a ventilator now more than a month after his symptoms eased glubisz feels on top of the world and his blood plasma just might be key to keeping someone else off a ventilator or preventing them from needing intubation its called convalescent plasma  using a survivors blood that has antibodies to rev up the immune system of a sick patient  an old idea once used in the spanish flu being applied to the novel coronavirus sweeping the world canadas first national clinical trial to test that theory is about to get underway after health canada rushed to approve research that was coordinated by scientists and researchers on zoom and latenight calls on wednesday glubisz became the first  survivor to donate his hopefully antibodyrich plasma to the canadian blood services new national  convalescent plasma collection program it will be screened for any other viruses like hepatitis b or hiv and within a week to  days as the trial launches potentially lifesaving plasma could be used to jumpstart the immune systems of patients in downtown toronto and montreal hospitals its a national collaborative clinical trial one of the largest  and swiftest to be mounted  in canada coordinated with the two public blood agencies so far  hospitals have registered to participate though they are at various stages of their own internal approvals the cancor trial as its called was approved by the federal regulator on april  led by dr donald arnold director of the mcmaster centre for transfusion research who teaches at mcmasters medical school the trial will enrol  patients  of whom will receive antibodyrich plasma while the other  will receive the standard of care now used in intensivecare units  the plan is to focus on areas that have the highest demand immediately  the hardesthit hospitals are in downtown toronto and montreal  and to roll it out across the country as soon as possible with luck he says it will be able to hit its intended target of  patients over the next four months there is a contingency plan to look at the data halfway through the trial to examine whether there is an overwhelming effect here thats good enough for us to say ‘this works we should just open it up arnold said in an interview its important to do this fast he said but its important to do it right because if you dont do it right then we still never get to an answer of whether or not this works in the us scientists and researchers are also mounting clinical trials including one in new york with a planned enrolment of  hospitalized patients arnold said as far as he knows none of them as big and none in the same population or at least not as big in the population were doing that is hospitalized  patients with respiratory illness needing oxygen theyre not yet that sick he said  the point is for us to try to prevent them from getting that sick and not needing the icu or not needing the ventilator the food and drug administration says although promising convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe and effective as a treatment for  however the fda has approved ways for doctors to use it in individual cases before the results of scientifically rigorous clinical trials are available and early observations of about  patients whove received convalescent plasma outside clinical trials are encouraging the milwaukee journalsentinel reported earlier this week it quoted mayo clinic researchers who are trying to keep tabs on those casebycase treatments a report thursday in the journal of american medicine cautioned however that globally there is a dearth of randomized controlled trials on the value of convalescent plasma for  patients the only reports in medical literature are from a handful of cases in china canadas chief public health officer dr theresa tam refused to discuss any positive signals coming from the american efforts or say when the treatment might be made more widely available in canada saying only that there are many treatments currently in trial and convalescent plasma is one canadian blood services chief scientist dr dana devine says the public blood authority and its quebec counterpart hémaquebec are now recruiting donors from among the more than  recovered patients in canada the blood agencies are seeking male donors under  whove had a positive lab test for the coronavirus and have been symptomfree for four weeks womens blood especially if theyve been pregnant often contains antibodies that complicate transfusions she explained when alicia taylor was laid off the week of march  she was concerned claiming employment insurance would eat into the maternity leave she was planning to take in may my biggest concern was am i losing my maternity leave because i was laid off because of this pandemic she said however on march  the canadian emergency relief benefit was announced and taylor is now receiving cerb as she waits to apply for maternity leave this worked out well for taylor because she was laid off after march  if taylor had been laid off just a week earlier and claimed ei she would be getting that benefit instead of cerb and her concerns would be justified receiving cerb does not affect entitlement to maternity and parental benefits but ei does said a spokesperson for employment and social development canada in an email employment experts say navigating this new mix of worker benefit programs could leave some pregnant parents  to fall through the cracks lara speirs executive vicepresident at human resources consulting firm randstad canada and toronto employment lawyer madeleine loewenberg are just two experts who hope the government can iron out the details so that expecting canadians on ei or cerb dont have to worry about getting their full maternity and parental benefits when the time comes  they have identified two ways in which the pandemic could be throwing a wrench in maternity and parental leave plans the first problem says speirs is the one taylor narrowly avoided  ei maternity and parental benefits are all administered through the same program a person is entitled to a total of  weeks regardless of the combination  meaning for every week of ei they take theyll get one less week of maternity or parental leave when a person combines regular benefits maternity benefits and standard parental benefits in one claim there is a limit of  weeks in total confirmed the government spokesperson the spokesperson also noted that there are options for extended parental benefits however loewenberg pointed out that while you can extend parental leave to get up to  months off you wont get any more money  youll just get less per week  regular maternity or parental leave is calculated like ei   per cent of insurable earnings up to  per week said loewenberg if you extend that leave which is possible for up to six extra months youll get  per cent of insurable earnings up to  per week  so if someone lost their job because of the pandemic applied for ei before march  and then later applies for maternity leave they will be eligible for fewer weeks of maternityparental leave and less money even if they extend their leave speirs thinks this gap could be fixed by either removing the arbitrary march  date or by allowing parentstobe already on ei to switch over to cerb youre effectively penalized for being pregnant and for the timing of your layoff she said loewenberg understands the government had to set a deadline but she thinks expecting canadians in this position shouldnt lose their benefits because of it the second issue said speirs is the fact that depending on an individuals previous employment situation and when they got laid off they might lose their eligibility for maternity or parental leave you need to accumulate  insured hours of work in the  weeks before you start your maternity or paternity claim she said so while someone may have cerb to tide them over after losing their income they might find themselves ineligible for maternity or parental leave when they apply the longer someone is on cerb and the fewer hours they worked in  the more likely this will affect their maternity claim loewenberg said the weeks of insurable earnings start to fall away the longer you wait from the loss of your employment to the date of your application she said adding that she sees this as a hole that has yet to be filled by the government there are a few other things expecting canadians should know if they plan to go on maternityparental leave or are just coming off of it said speirs and loewenberg canadians have the option of applying for maternity leave early within  weeks of the expected birth date if you were temporarily laid off at first and then find yourself permanently laid off during your maternity or parental leave you are entitled to severance by the end of your leave said speirs and if you just got off of maternity or parental leave and are now out of work because of  youre eligible for cerb she said speirs noted that in quebec  a leader when it comes to parental leave  a parent can pause the maternity or parental leave to go back to work for a brief period of time  both loewenberg and speirs recommend those waiting for maternity leave should take cerb in the meantime even though there are a few unanswered questions ottawacliff groen gulped when he saw the numbers  it was the middle of march and even as the economy quavered and  evolved into a global pandemic groen and his colleagues at service canada were chugging along as usual jobless claims stayed steady at around  each day processed at the routine pace of bureaucracy  then the wave hit and it hit hard  service canada got more than  applications for employment insurance on march  the most ever in a single day  until the next day when it got more than   by the time the tally for the third day came in at more than  claims groen knew routine wasnt good enough anymore they would need to change everything  fast  definitely there was a big gulp on my part and lots of my colleagues groen the assistant deputy minister of benefits delivery at service canada told the star by phone this week  unless we did something dramatically different he said there would be no way we would be able to process those applications on any kind of a timely basis  you could say the necessity to do something completely different is the modus operandi of the public service in the time of coronavirus with thousands of workers shifting to home offices ottawa has redeployed workers to process millions of jobless claims as groen and his team designed a whole new program to replace ei and reach more people  its called the canada emergency response benefit  over the span of just three weeks  at the same time the government has reimagined its industrial policy to rally canadian companies to the coronavirus fight by converting factories to pump out muchneeded medical equipment charles vincent an acting assistant deputy minister responsible for  industry mobilization said he has seen hundreds of civil servants step up to clock in extra hours to field thousands of proposals to help domestic manufacturers convert to help with the pandemic fight this included a complete reorganization of his department as workers focus exclusively on the crisis he said  i have not seen anything quite like this ever before to be frank and its been three weeks at this pace    hours a day seven days a week he said groen and his team at service canada shifted into high gear that week after they received recordsetting jobless claims for three days in a row that was a call to arms for the team groen said which began immediately with a rush of meetings and briefings to other departments and cabinet ministers about the tsunami of ei claims flooding in  groen said it was clear even then that the current ei system wouldnt cut it they needed something simpler and quicker they also wanted to make sure people that arent eligible for regular ei  like selfemployed business owners and people who leave work to care for someone else  received government support amid the pandemic he said  the other key element was it needed to be extremely speedy we knew that we couldnt take months to develop and launch this new program groen said  the rush carried into that weekend march  and  as public servants scrambled to write legislation to create the new benefit groen said it workers with service canada and the canada revenue agency also started the crucial task of creating the web platform for applications that would need to be able to carry the huge volume of expected requests he said  like many of his colleagues groen said he was working  to  hour days walking home to crash briefly before returning to the service canada headquarters in gatineau que  typically there are lots of checks and balances within government normally the policy design is developed and theres consultation and theres review by different areas within government groen said  instead from the realization a new program was needed when legislation was tabled in the house of commons on march  six days had passed after that it was a matter of testing the system to make sure it could handle the volume and then applications opened april 6  about  million of 5 million claims had been processed by thursday this week including ei claims since march  that were rolled into the new benefit according to employment minister carla qualtroughs office in my career and ive been a public servant for over  years i have never seen anything in that order and then in less than three weeks it was fully launched groen said  theres nothing in my career that compares to that  mollie jacques is a chef in toronto who lost her job last month applied for ei and received two payments already this week while she questioned whether she received the right amount of money and noted many she knows in her beleaguered industry are still confused how the benefit works jacques said she is impressed to see the payments flowing so soon as someone who has applied for ei before two to three months is the normal amount of time it takes she said ive dealt with the government quite a bit over the years and snails pace is what i normally expect … im honestly surprised that it has come together this quickly groen said he has never been prouder to be a public servant that during the pandemic  especially when we were able to launch the benefit and knew that people were going to be able to get their payments tears did come to lots of our eyes he said we were so happy and proud that we … were there for canadians  the latest round of government projections related to the  pandemic includes an increasingly common phrase  reaching the peak but what exactly does that mean some experts weigh in what does it mean to reach a peak in a pandemic infectious disease and statistical modelling specialists say to reach the peak in a pandemic curve means that the number of new cases has begun to level off rather than continuing on a sharp upward trajectory such a scenario is playing out this week in ontario where public health officials said the province was experiencing the peak of the outbreak in the broader community despite registering some sharp singleday spikes in the number of new cases the peak has not yet arrived in the provinces longterm care system where roughly half of all cases and deaths have occurred peaks are not a single day said steini brown dean of the dalla lana school of public health at the university of toronto as he presented the provinces latest projections on monday theyre not a nice single sort of spike they can be a little bit bumpy they can be prolonged for a period of time particularly given public health interventions brown said pandemic curves are usually symmetrical in nature  a sharp increase of cases is followed by the plateau or peak which then gives way to a decline in new diagnoses where in canada is that actually happening while ontario may be experiencing the peak of community transmission right now several provinces are already ahead of the game public health officials in british columbia said last week that they had succeeded in flattening the curve meaning theyre past the peak of new  cases provinces and territories such as manitoba saskatchewan and the yukon are posting singledigit increases each day while new brunswick prince edward island and newfoundland and labrador have gone several days in a row without any new cases at all canadas chief public health officer dr theresa tam has said the national curve is bending but has yet to flatten those figures are still fuelled by data out of quebec and ontario the epicentres of the national outbreak the premier of quebec which has recorded more than  of canadas roughly  cases has said the peak has lightly been reached outside of the provinces hardhit longterm care homes this is all good news right yes and no dr isaac bogoch infectious diseases physician and scientist with the toronto general hospital says its very encouraging to see the rate of new infections begin to level off but he says peak times also promise to place the maximum strain on the healthcare system as cases continue to mount at a pace not seen during earlier stages of the outbreak jianhong wu distinguished research professor of mathematics at york university said other risks come with pandemic peaks at these times the level of infections is highest he said the number of cases is not necessarily the number of infections wu noted that disparity is even more evident in parts of the country with lower testing levels noting those provinces with higher capacity will also uncover more cases during a peak period he said canadians stand a higher chance of contracting the virus does this mean normal life can resume soon no both wu and bogoch said physical distancing measures are more important than ever during peak times in order to ensure the number of cases begins to decline as expected imagine youre in a car and you put your foot on the gas and are driving faster and faster bogoch said when you get onto the highway and youre going  kilometres an hour thats not the time to open the door and jump out of the car you have to actually slow down what are the most useful stats to keep an eye on the many facts and figures presented in government briefings are all valuable in tracking canadas response to  according to both bogoch and wu but for a member of the public wanting only to focus on the highlights they agree tracking the growth rate of cases over time should provide an adequate snapshot both caution against focusing on singleday stats and suggest looking at the overall trend to see if cases are climbing peaking or declining over time'"

paper disproving the theory saying the virus was too lethal to be manmade it is a product of nature no scientist could have put it together in a laboratory we dont know enough about virus to have constructed something this lethal and have spread in the human population prof garry told abc news he said the scientists at the wuhan institute of virology are at the top of their field and the probability of a lab accident causing the pandemic was extremely low i have never been to the wuhan institute of virology but i do know several good virologists that have been there the scientists there have a sterling reputation prof garry said theyre very productive scientists they publish a lot of great papers not only on coronaviruses but other viruses so i would say theyre at the top of

scientific evidence is very very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated mr fauci told the magazine everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that this virus evolved in nature and then jumped species he said mr trump increasingly critical of chinas management of the outbreak claims to have proof it started in the wuhan institute and us secretary of state mike pompeo said enormous evidence backed up that claim although the us intelligence community last week said it would continue to study whether the outbreak

criticism from mr trump over accusations it initially downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak to shield china  has repeatedly said the virus clearly appears to have originated naturally from an animal source who expert maria van kerkhove stressed during mondays briefing that there were some  full genome sequences of the novel coronavirus available and from all of the evidence that we have seen … this virus is of natural origin while coronaviruses generally originate in bats both ms van kerkhove and mr ryan stressed the importance of discovering how the virus that causes  crossed over to humans and what animal served as an intermediary host along the way we need to understand more about that natural origin and particularly about intermediate hosts mr ryan said it was important to know so that we can put in place the right public health and animalhuman interface policies that will prevent this happening again he stressed the who said last week it wanted to be invited to take part in chinese investigations into the animal origins of the pandemic which in a matter of months has killed more than  people worldwide we have offered as we do with every case in every country assistance with carrying out those investigations ryan said on monday we can learn from chinese scientists he said but he warned that if questions about the viruss origin were projected as aggressive investigation of wrongdoing than i believe thats much more difficult to deal with that is a political issue science needs to be at the centre he said if we have a sciencebased investigation and a
